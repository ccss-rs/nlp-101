I think you'd be surprised. A lot of people tend to fall for the view that discipline is all but non-existent, or that the union is more powerful, or as powerful, or even anywhere near as powerful, as the city.

Just look at pensions.  Outside of the public sector pretty much no union has been able to keep in-place what we have for many public sector pensions, and for good reason.  But the govt doesn't have the insolvency risk that gets unions to finally accept reasonable change.

Do they, though? It took 9/11 for people to realize that firefighter's radios didn't work in tall buildings. During Covid, the fire department was telling its positive members to come to work if they weren't experiencing severe symptoms. The Fire Union asked for regular testing for firefighters for over a year, and didn't get it until a month ago (which was then superseded by the mandate).

The 'accountability' I was referring to was the lack of it, in terms of the shoddy work standards and conduct we see from many public sector workers.  Not really an FDNY issue since we don't see them loafing around subway stations on their phones (either NYPD or MTA).

""The history of all hitherto existing society(2)¬†is the history of class struggles.
Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guild-master(3)¬†and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to one another, carried on an uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time ended, either in a revolutionary reconstitution of society at large, or in the common ruin of the contending classes.
In the earlier epochs of history, we find almost everywhere a complicated arrangement of society into various orders, a manifold gradation of social rank. In ancient Rome we have patricians, knights, plebeians, slaves in the Middle Ages, feudal lords, vassals, guild-masters, journeymen, apprentices, serfs in almost all of these classes, again, subordinate gradations.
The modern bourgeois society that has sprouted from the ruins of feudal society has not done away with class antagonisms. It has but established new classes, new conditions of oppression, new forms of struggle in place of the old ones.
Our epoch, the epoch of the bourgeoisie, possesses, however, this distinct feature: it has simplified class antagonisms. Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps, into two great classes directly facing each other ‚Äî Bourgeoisie and Proletariat.
From the serfs of the Middle Ages sprang the chartered burghers of the earliest towns. From these burgesses the first elements of the bourgeoisie were developed.
The discovery of America, the rounding of the Cape, opened up fresh ground for the rising bourgeoisie. The East-Indian and Chinese markets, the colonisation of America, trade with the colonies, the increase in the means of exchange and in commodities generally, gave to commerce, to navigation, to industry, an impulse never before known, and thereby, to the revolutionary element in the tottering feudal society, a rapid development.
The feudal system of industry, in which industrial production was monopolised by closed guilds, now no longer sufficed for the growing wants of the new markets. The manufacturing system took its place. The guild-masters were pushed on one side by the manufacturing middle class division of labour between the different corporate guilds vanished in the face of division of labour in each single workshop.
Meantime the markets kept ever growing, the demand ever rising. Even manufacturer no longer sufficed. Thereupon, steam and machinery revolutionised industrial production. The place of manufacture was taken by the giant, Modern Industry the place of the industrial middle class by industrial millionaires, the leaders of the whole industrial armies...""",6,10/18/21

White natives of NYC are welcome to live there by the locals. But outsiders are treated a little differently. It's a NY thing. Harlem has been having a gentrification struggle since the 90s forcing many locals to leave the state because of the high rent.

92752,_TheConsumer_,"Dr. Sellers' interpretation of the matter is incorrect. First and foremost, he is likely referring to the Jacobson Case regarding ""100 years of upholding vaccination requirements."" The problem with that is Jacobson is far different from the current mandates. In Jacobson, the state gave residents the following choice: ""Get vaccinated, pay a fine, or prove to us you are otherwise exempt."" With that type of approach, the SC held that a resident could avoid the vaccine by paying the fine or proving a different exemption. With the current mandates, there are no exemptions. Different mandates require different analyses. Therefore, Jacobson does not apply. 

Secondly, Dr. Sellers is conflating ""your religious institution"" with ""your religious beliefs."" The SC has never defined a religion because it does not want to set a precedent for a ""state defined religion."" The only definition we have for religion is, to quote the SC in Welsh v. US:

 The Court's principal statement of its test for determining whether a conscientious objector's beliefs are religious within the meaning of ¬ß 6(j) was as follows: The test might be stated in these words: **A sincere and meaningful belief which occupies in the life of its possessor a place parallel to that filled by the God**

 The Court made it clear that these sincere and meaningful beliefs that prompt the registrant's objection to all wars need not be confined in either source or content to traditional or parochial concepts of religion. It held that ¬ß 6(j) 'does not distinguish between externally and internally derived beliefs,' id., at 186, 85 S.Ct., at 864 and also held that *'intensely personal'* convictions which *some might find 'incomprehensible' or 'incorrect'* come within the meaning of **'religious belief'**

In short: religion is personal. The state isn't to look to a Pope, Rabbi, or Imam for your exemption.

To close - just because a mandate comes out of the mouth of an elected official does not mean it is constitutional. Your leaders are misleading you in that regard. Just last year, Cuomo and BdB both believed they had the constitutional authority to close churches/temples/mosques because of the virus. This sub wholeheartedly agreed. The SC did not. 

Your leaders are doing the same thing now: screaming about how constitutional their authority is, while showing a general lack of understanding of the constitution and SC precedence.",-6,9/15/21

85275,mzito,"I think it depends a touch on the definition of ""accepts"" - for example, running a red light is illegal, and if you see a taxi driver do it, you can report them to the TLC and they will actually write a ticket as long as you have the medallion number and a credible story about how you saw it, what happened, etc.   The \_police\_ don't enforce the red light rules as much as they should (though one of the three times I've been pulled over in my life was for accidentally running a red light), but there is at least some enforcement that happens.  

In the community, as well, it's not uncommon to have people agitate for greater enforcement of these types of rules - in my neighborhood a few years back there was a rash of pedestrians hit by vehicles, people got angry and wrote letters, complained, and the DOT came out and made some changes to try to make things better.  Reasonable people can debate whether that was sufficient, but the status quo wasn't \*accepted\*.

In the case of Revel, I think it's a combination of a) it's not the driver's vehicle, so why care about taking care of it, b) it's fun - it's quick and zippy, and handles well, c) the barrier to entry is pretty low, so there's little consideration or friction in taking one, and d) it is obviously not a car, and so maybe you can treat it like a bike.  Put all these things together and you have a situation where it might seem totally reasonable to drive the wrong way down a side street, or ride on the sidewalk, or run a red light, because we ""accept"" those things from bicyclists.  

I am a huge scooter fan, I used to drive one around the city years ago, but they're not toys, and the technology exists such that Revel could do a lot more enforcement \_if they cared to\_. I guarantee that they can see how fast a scooter is going, and if a scooter averages 20+ mph in Manhattan for more than a few blocks, it's almost certainly running lights or driving aggressively.

For instance, full height turnstiles (which are contactless in other countries) will allow cops to be on platforms instead of watching turnstiles. Improved cameras, barriers on the platform, and benches that you can‚Äôt lay on will discourage bad behavior and make the subway safer/faster. 

This doesn‚Äôt mean infrastructure improvements will make the subway perfect. We all need to be on the same page that the subway is not a homeless shelter. One aspect of this is allowing cops &amp social workers to remove homeless people from the subway (I say cops because many will refuse assistance). The other aspect is improving homelessness and mental health around the city. Construct more modestly-sized apartments with the goal of creating affordable permanent housing. Complete reform on zoning regulations. Replacing current shelters with ones which are safer and more comfortable with access to services for finding employment/housing/benefits (temporary). The list goes on.

126130,gilbertgrappa,"For almost 40 years, New Yorkers knew the Grand Prospect Hall by one simple phrase: ‚ÄúWe make your dreams come true!‚Äù
Now, the dreamland may soon be demolished: The new owner of the building, an iconic Victorian banquet hall, has applied for it to be torn down, public records show.
Purchased by Michael and Alice Halkias in 1981, the Grand Prospect Hall became famous for its campy, low-budget television commercials, which were set to soaring orchestral music and featured the couple throwing out their arms and making their signature promise. So popular were the ads that they were spoofed by both ‚ÄúSaturday Night Live‚Äù and ‚ÄúJimmy Kimmel Live.‚Äù
In its heyday, the ballroom was transformed hundreds of times a year for weddings, proms, bat and bar mitzvahs, and even New York‚Äôs first L.G.B.T.Q. comic book convention.
But the venue took several major hits during the coronavirus pandemic, beginning with the building‚Äôs closure in March 2020, followed by the death of Mr. Halkias that May from complications of Covid-19.
The building was sold in June this year as part of a $30 million 12-property deal to Angelo Rigas, a contractor, through the company Gowanus Cubes LLC, public records show. Neither Mr. Rigas nor his lawyer, Oded Ben-Ami, responded to several requests for comment about their plans for the space. The Brooklyn Paper was the first to report that demolition permits had been filed.
New Yorkers who held their weddings, birthday parties and other events at the Grand Prospect Hall over the years expressed surprise and devastation over the building‚Äôs future demise.
Laura Burns, 52, and Peter Sharoff, 49, chose it as their wedding venue after attending Ms. Burns‚Äô grandmother‚Äôs 95th birthday party there. Her grandmother told stories of how she and her friends would go to the Grand Prospect Hall in the 1920s and dance into the wee hours.
‚ÄúYou walk inside, and immediately you cannot decide ‚Äî is this the most wonderful, almost St. Petersburg-like glamour you have ever seen?‚Äù Mr. Sharoff said. ‚ÄúOr is it the most awful, kitschy, tacky place you have ever seen?‚Äù
Told by The New York Times about the demolition plans, several neighboring business owners were taken aback.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very sad,‚Äù said Ayman Hassan, who owns Park Slope Hardware, which is around the corner on Fifth Avenue. He first met the Halkias family when his business opened in 1995, he said.
Over the decades that followed, his store sold countless tools and supplies to the venue, he said. Whenever he saw Mr. Halkias, they would catch up and make jokes. In 2016, Mr. Hassan said, his nephew was married at the Grand Prospect Hall.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a neighborhood fixture,‚Äù Mr. Hassan said, ‚Äúbut I think they suffered a lot in the past year.‚Äù
Apollo, who manages his family‚Äôs dry cleaning business a block away and declined to give his full name, said they used to dry clean the Halkiases‚Äô formal wear. He said the two families connected over their shared Greek roots when the laundry opened 21 years ago.
‚ÄúThey should have made that place a landmark,‚Äù Apollo said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm definitely hurt.‚Äù
Although the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1999, it was never made an official city landmark, leaving it unprotected from development.
Toby Pannone, 18, and his girlfriend, Solya Spiegel, 16, grew up in Brooklyn and attended a range of events at the Grand Prospect Hall, from eighth-grade proms to Balkan music festivals.
After learning about the demolition plans last week, Mr. Pannone said, they created a petition to save the building, which has garnered thousands of signatures, and submitted a request to the city‚Äôs Landmarks Preservation Commission to review the building.
‚ÄúObviously, you can‚Äôt preserve everything. You can‚Äôt keep the city stagnant, you have to make changes,‚Äù Mr. Pannone said. ‚ÄúBut despite being a privately owned venue, it is truly a public and communal space for Brooklyn.""
The Grand Prospect Hall has a long history in the borough. Built in 1892 by an entrepreneur named John Kolle, it originally served as a playground for rich New Yorkers, according to its website.
In its early incarnation, it had bowling alleys, a billiard room, a shooting gallery and Brooklyn‚Äôs first ‚Äúbird cage‚Äù elevator, which allowed passengers to see outside. It was also Brooklyn‚Äôs first fully electrified commercial building, according to the site.
The venue has since been used to film movies and TV shows like ‚ÄúThe Royal Tenenbaums,‚Äù the ‚ÄúTwin Peaks‚Äù reboot and the original ‚ÄúGossip Girl.‚Äù
Mr. and Ms. Halkias were often game to change up the d√©cor for events, allowing patrons to bring in as many props as they wanted. Ms. Burns and Mr. Sharoff, inspired by the building‚Äôs opulent interior, had a Venetian-style masked wedding, complete with stilt walkers and fire jugglers.
For their retro-style wedding in 2013, Angie Pontani and Brian Newman brought in a 20-foot-tall glitter backdrop, a 16-piece big band and a multi-tier wedding cake inspired by ‚ÄúThe Godfather.‚Äù
Before her wedding, Ms. Pontani, 44, who grew up in New Jersey, only knew the Grand Prospect Hall from its TV ads and had never been inside. She and Mr. Newman initially decided to take a look just as a joke.
As soon as the tour had ended, she said, they knew they‚Äôd found the one. The next step was convincing their friends.
‚ÄúI had to be like, ‚ÄòListen to me. You are going to go crazy once you walk through those doors and see that marble staircase. You‚Äôre going to lose your mind,‚Äô‚Äù Ms. Pontani said.
Amy and David Bandler, who were married there in 1995, were surprised by their friends‚Äô incredulous reactions when they told them about the venue they had chosen. Though both grew up in New York, neither recalled seeing the ads.
‚ÄúThey were all laughing about it like it was a joke,‚Äù Ms. Bandler, 53, recalled. ‚ÄúI was like, ‚ÄòNo, it‚Äôs really pretty inside!‚Äô‚Äù
The Bandlers lived in Park Slope, blocks away from the Grand Prospect Hall, for many years before moving to Montclair, N.J. Each time they return, they said, the dramatic changes to the neighborhood make them feel a sense of culture shock.
‚ÄúIt is a shame to see unique and interesting and storied buildings disappear,‚Äù Mr. Bandler, 54, said. ‚ÄúYou just see pieces of your history disappearing.‚Äù
Ms. Pontani said she and her husband had always planned to return to the Grand Prospect Hall and hold their 25th anniversary party there.
‚ÄúI can‚Äôt imagine the heart of the person who would walk in there and say, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm going to tear this down,‚Äô‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a loss for the city.‚Äù
On a cloudy afternoon this week, the once-boisterous hall was shuttered, silent and lifeless, with much of the interior already ripped up. A letter dated July 2020 approving the building‚Äôs temporary liquor license still hung on the glass doors of the front entrance.
‚ÄúThe more we take down things like this, the more we lose our own New York history,‚Äù Mr. Sharoff said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm biased. I got married there. But I think it‚Äôs unfortunate that we think to move ahead, we have to demolish the past.‚Äù",1,8/26/21

NY has 287 deaths per 100,000 which puts is at #4 on the list. 19.34M and 4th most populated state in the country

Florida has 267 deaths per 100,000 which puts it as #10. FL has a total population of 21.73M and 3rd most populated state in the country.

Florida has even distributed more vaccines than New York. (However as you can see NY is less populated, so likely NY has a higher pecentage of residents vaccinated which would be the reql rate to compare.)

Vaccines distributed:
Florida 27,534,371
New York 26,470,399

Here is a pecentage of population vaccinated and their number on the list:

‚ÄúThey‚Äôve quit your job if they don‚Äôt get the shot?‚Äù Employers are dumb to assume that, and you are even dumber for saying and believing it. Not getting the shot only means they cannot meet the requirement of the job they perform. Last time I checked, ‚Äúno longer meeting the requirements of a job‚Äù only resulted in someone being re-trained or terminated from their job. They may be pushed to voluntarily resign, but did not exclude them from collecting unemployment benefits if they didn‚Äôt do anything criminal in the course of their employment. That‚Äôs the law. Read it.

There are some shady employers who try to prevent employees from collecting unemployment because they would have to pay for the unemployment benefits collected by the employee, so they make employees state they voluntarily resigned. However, it has been shown that in more than enough appeals decisions with state unemployment offices that these employees were still entitled to collect unemployment even if they quit. It‚Äôs called ‚Äùconstructive resignation.‚Äù Take a look at a few of these cases before you say I type alot  and said nothing. It may help put you in closer touch with reality and help you understand a bit about the laws that work for employees rather than against them.

Also, there have been many companies that found ways to repurpose employees who can no longer perform their roles due to a disabling condition to continue to be productive with the organization. If you haven‚Äôt heard, it‚Äôs called an accommodation, and it has saved them from lawsuits, and it has further put the costs of unemployment to better use for the employer.

And sure, they are all IV league educated and could have made $200K plus in their first year a big law firm, but when they saw the opportunity to earn $60K per year working as a public Court Clerk, they knew the sacrifice would be worth it when they made it to SCOTUS and laughed in the libs faces.

It‚Äôs not about eliminating competition, it‚Äôs about ensuring that students can have access to the best possible education and be elevated to a better academic position. Speaking from experience it can be done.

As an additional side note: if you‚Äôre so against ‚Äúsocialism,‚Äù I hope you have never used and won‚Äôt use unemployment insurance in the future, or will voluntarily return you social security checks when that time comes.

It has documented that thousands more patients have died from the COVID-19 vaccine (already), than patients that have when they have taken the flu vaccine.  Are the vaccines useful?  Sure they are, as long as you don‚Äôt have SAEs. Why haven‚Äôt people who have natural immunity to COVID-19 been released from mandates for the COVID-19 vaccine, when the data shows that those people are 27x less likely to get ill from COVID-19 than fully vaccinated patients? I‚Äôm vaccinated because my employer forced me to get the vaccine or I would lose my job, even though I have documentation of testing positive for COVID-19 antibodies after having contracted COVID-19.  Why ES I forced then?  Makes no sense.  My issue isn‚Äôt as much the vaccine per se, as is the mandating of them.  That said, there is clearly a safety issue with the COVID-19 vaccines that concerns me (ex: myocarditis). For those that don‚Äôt think that these are serious enough, Moderna‚Äôs COVID-19 has been pulled from the market in some Nordic countries for certain patient age groups due to the myocarditis issue.  Anyway, people shouldn‚Äôt be forced to take COVID-19 vaccines. The mortality rate for COVID-19 is not 5%, 10%, 20%, or 30%.  In the grand scheme of things, very few people have died from COVID-19, and here in the US, many many people have been vaccinated and many many people have developed natural immunity.

104916,delinquentfatcat,"Thank you for this excellent and factual summary. Wrote a letter to my council member:

Dear \[name\],

I am a New York City resident and voter in your District \[x\]. I am writing¬†to express my grave concern with a proposed bill, Intro 2047, that puts a blanket ban on criminal background checks for individuals applying to private housing. I understand the good intentions behind this bill to give ex-convicts a better chance to rebuild their life. However, such a drastic change affects not only thousands of ex-convicted criminals, but also the safety and self-determination of millions of everyday men, women, and children living in our city.

Unfortunately, it appears that not all affected parties were invited to be part of this conversation.

I understand the goal of rehabilitating convicts such that they reintegrate into society. It is a difficult road, and not many are willing to voluntarily give an ex-convict shelter or a chance at employment. A few kind-hearted people are -- but the severity, age and repeatedness of the crime still matters to them, as it reasonably should. However, the proposed bill will obscure all differences between serial murder, a sex crime, a hit-and-run auto accident, and no prior criminality at all. In effect, the public will be blindfolded, stripped of its freedom of association, and volunteered into a dangerous experiment in an attempt to make things better for former criminals -- who may or may not be ready to part with a violent past, as the city's 42% recidivism rate shows.

It's noteworthy that even progressive, left-leaning cities (Chicago, Detroit) have enacted a far milder version of the proposed law: screening is allowed for certain, particularly egregious types of convictions. These cities remain aware of their duty to protect the public's safety first. By contrast, Intro 2047 makes practically no such provisions. There is no consideration at all for protecting the innocent.

NYC residents have a right to live in a safe home with their families. The City has a legal obligation to protect the safety of its citizens, and this obligation cannot be traded away for overtures towards individuals who proved capable of causing grave harm towards their fellow humans. Intro 2047 needs to be either modified and renegotiated with all stakeholders present, or scrapped.

39845,ChornWork2,"There were far more nursing home residents released from hospitals, than there were beds available at the peak, even factoring in the emergency facilities.  And that's an exercise in hindsight, had the cuomo's action on the lockdown or his efforts to bring in out-of-state healthcare workers not been as effective as they were, those beds would have been needed by patients requiring emergency care.  

It doesn't take a genius to know you don't put sick people back into high risk populations.

You're ignoring that the virus was already in those high risk populations.  One-in-five NYC'ers got covid during the initial outbreak, and because of Trump's utter failure on testing we had no way to confirm even cases where someone was showing symptoms, let alone asymptomatic cases.  There was not magic shield protecting nursing home workers... effectively one-in-five of those workers were unwittingly exposing nursing homes to the virus.  That as a means of transmission utterly dwarfs the risk from *known* covid cases.

That blunder is still responsible for the largest single number of NYC covid deaths and a large portion of overall NYC covid deaths.

Find me a credible expert that says it was even responsible for a significant portion of covid deaths, let along the largest number.  And of course you're ignoring the blunder that actually caused the scale of nursing home deaths, and deaths more generally in NY and the country, which was the utter failure by the Trump admin to prepare for covid.  He admitted on tape he was downplaying the risk.  ANd obviously he utterly fucked up testing.  And if you recall, the feds were blocking state and local labs from developing their own testing capacity.  They didn't change those rules until the last day of February after Cuomo, DiBlasio and others were calling out the government for the insane policy... presumably trump wanted to control the information flow, and that cost us countless lives.

Only NYC made the stupid decision to send sick old people back into nursing homes.

Incorrect.  California and New Jersey also briefly had the policy when it looked like they were going to run out of hospital beds.

NYCs biggest spike the entire time was from the nursing home incident.

don't understand what you're saying here.  Look at nursing home deaths as % of total covid deaths if you want.  NY is NOT an outlier on that metric (even with the full data, not the date fudge), despite having among the highest proportion of nursing home residents.  There is no credible evidence that points to significant deaths from this policy.",1,10/15/21

Property value is based on demand and desire to live anywhere.  The life of the city depends on its livability. If you just let building to go uncontrolled and let money decide the kind of building  built anywhere than the city will become unlivable and more like Blade Runner every day.  

In the end everything that made an area attractive to live in for both owners and renters is destroyed by developers seeking to sell anything until the area is exhausted.  This eventually destroys the intrinsic value (desire, livability and yes value) of the area.  It then starts to fail and goes into decline.

So there is always a balance between the demand for apartments in an area and the reason there is a demand for living in that area.  Once you exhaust the area with buildings, destroy the cause of the desirability and refuse to control the urban planning you lose the area.  Being Manhattan you exhaust the island eventually.

Blackstone was founded by Lehman bros alums. 
Banks and private investment are not mutually exclusive? Blackstone and many of its subsidiaries over the years have acted as investment managers and advisors. Or management consultants. Or any of a million things. Lehman Bros also provided investment management and private equity services. Your distinction is a deflection.

I‚Äôm inclined to say the difference is that vaccination (or lack thereof) affects the health of those around you ‚Äî so it‚Äôs not just your body you are making a choice for. 

Of course there is a similar argument there for abortion, in that you could argue it‚Äôs not just your body, but also the fetus‚Äô that an abortion could impact.  

I think it comes down to what your belief is as to when a fetus constitutes a human life.  

The other argument is you do have a choice to remain unvaccinated, you just lose out on a lot of what society has to offer ‚Äî but with states rights, some states are more unvaccinated ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù than others.  So the choice is there, just live with the repercussions.

Instead of taking away something that benefits the best and the brightest we should be figuring out how to do something else that benefits the most disadvantaged. And figuring that out is actually really really easy, but no one wants it.

The best way to help the disadvantaged kids is to take away neighborhood priority, mix all the kids up, then bus them to random schools all over the city. That method would fix all of the problems and no one wants it. No one wants their kid to go to a school two hours away just for the sake of integration.

But in one way I agree. Typically it isn't helpful to compare a place as large as NYC as a whole to any other municipality in the USA because it's just too populated and consists of too diverse a collection of communities. It contains a much greater share of the metro population than most places.

Here is the boroughs broken down:

* The Bronx: 920.9
* Brooklyn: 550.8
* Manhattan: 601.8
* Queens: 413.1
* Staten Island: 273.2

114075,elendinel,"I don't know which storm or state you're referring to.

If you mean Texas it wasn't just a problem of fixing previous issues from a previous storm. The problem was that generally speaking Texas has not kept up with repairing its infrastructure has resisted connecting to larger power grids for years out of a sense of unfounded rugged individualism, which limits how much power the state has available for its citizens even in edge cases like extreme temperatures and has resisted the use of renewable energy that could at the very least help supplement its power grid output, out of political opposition to such energy. Again that's not to say the solution was cheap, but it's all stuff the state could certainly invest in now to rectify the issue in the foreseeable future. Part of the problem, frankly, is that we all know TX won't because the governor was content to blame renewable energy for the failure and move on. 

With NYC it's not an issue of just needing to update infrastructure or to accept help from outside the city. You'd essentially have to ban certain types of apartments in a city that already has a shortage of affordable housing, and add additional underground water management in a city with extensive underground tunnels for transportation, and raise several areas well above sea water or build dams or water levees like there are in other areas to prevent flooding from rivers and the ocean. There's also not an issue of the city blaming a scapegoat for the flooding and moving on the city has been actively repairing itself since Sandy and trying to flood proof things like the transportation system to prevent the sorts of shutdowns and flooding we saw back then.

Don't need to re-register.

You have until 20 days before a general, primary, or special election to inform the New York County board of a elections of a name change, otherwise you may end up unable to vote on election day. This is separate from the registration deadline.

&amp#x200B

This is a systemic DOE issue, not something to be fixed with a Band-Aid.

The issue is that someone could be purged from the rolls and not know it, and not be permitted to vote on election day, other than by provisional ballot which may or may not be approved in a timely manner. Same-day registration completely fixes that problem. Showing up to the polling place seems as clear a way as any to prove that you're not an inactive voter.

&amp#x200B

What? If you fill it out yourself, the volunteer isn't doing anything.

Maybe you handwriting sucks. Maybe they mistyped something into a computer. Maybe they tripped and dropped a pile of forms in a ditch.

&amp#x200B

The point is, there's all sorts of reasons why someone may not give a shit about an election until late in the game, or may be under the impression that they're already registered but aren't. They're not difficult to imagine, and happen all the time.

And sure, you're welcome to say that they should all be more diligent and pay strict attention to those deadlines and their voter status.

But that process, those deadlines, are all basically arbitrary. And we know that they depress legitimate voter turnout, especially among certain working class and minority communities. So why not eliminate them? The ""because fraud!"" answer does not hold up to scrutiny.

Jails are usually local facilities under the jurisdiction of a city, local district, or county. Jails are short-term holding facilities for the newly arrested and those awaiting trial or sentencing. Those sentenced to serve a small amount of time (less than a year) may be housed in the local jail for the duration of their sentence.

 **PRISON**

 Prisons are institutional facilities under the jurisdiction of the state or federal government where convicted offenders serve longer sentences. People who have been found guilty of breaking a state law are usually sent to a state prison. Those who have violated federal laws are typically sent to federal prison located somewhere in the U.S. Some states have jails and prisons that are privately operated‚Äìusually by a corporation.

Yes, and a majority of people don't suffer from poverty, so we should just ignore the problem? 

Saying that it's to ""their own demise"" is incorrect. It doesn't just kill that person, it has the potential to mutate in said person (which we have evidence of it happening with all the variants) and become more deadly and infectious. It doesn't just affect that individual, it affects us all in the long term. Now my vaccine is less effective against Delta because people didn't want to vaccinate. I know that Delta originated in India iirc but there's nothing stopping another strain from mutating in America in less vaccinated areas. 

You THINK you'd be totally fine, but you don't know, and you can't know. Chances are you will be based off the statistics, but you could also die. The immune system isn't perfect, yours could not learn how to handle COVID and you can die or be affected by it for the foreseeable future. 

There already is a massively reduced risk for vaccinated individuals, but every time the virus mutates, that risk increases, which is why it isn't a problem only for the unvaccinated. You're also forgetting the fact (actual fact) that hospitals are being overcrowded and people with life threatening accidents or illnesses are unable to get medical treatment. 

""In Arizona, 94.1 percent of new COVID-19 cases involve unvaccinated people.  
Even in Tennessee, where vaccination coverage is at 41 percent, fully vaccinated people who acquired the coronavirus is only 0.4 percent.""

So you're telling me if someone dies from a gunshot wound because there's no space in a hospital, all those unvaccinated individuals are not to blame? There is absolutely no blame on them? When chances are if they had taken the vaccine they wouldn't be in the hospital taking up space that is needed for others? 

Why do you wear a seatbelt? If you die from a car accident because you weren't wearing a seatbelt, you're a moron. You could've easily prevented your death but instead chose to listen to conspiracies how seatbelts were created by Jewish space lasers to keep us stuck in our seats when we're being beamed up.

The only tipped people who are not reporting cash are counter staff with a tip cup or hotel employees who keep their handshake tips.

McClellan's decision startled the two top Interborough executives on board the train, Vice-President E. M. Bryan and General Frank M. Hedley.

I took my first pictures from rooftops in the East Village and SoHo and then grabbed my 35mm, some rolls of films, a dust mask I had and ran downtown. We are indestructible when we're young, right?

Getting to the site was fairly straightforward on Tuesday, everything and everyone was in disarray, disaster mode. I got to the site at 11am, about half an hour after the North Tower imploded. 

It was like a martian landscape with firefighters walking around aimlessly as if they were suffering from shell shock. 

I stood at the site with a priest from Paul's Chapel (I assume). We both stood there just staring at this crater of death. I remember he was tall and crying.

I spent the day handing out water to firefighters and digging through debris. At a certain point a white shirt FDNY guy asked me to follow some firefighters into a residential building to look for signs of life. We kicked down doors as we headed up this building's staircase and yelled out to see if anyone was still in there. All the windows were blown out. I have a pretty clear memory of standing in a child's room with super tall ceilings and hand painted giraffes on the wall. Luckily everyone had seemingly evacuated.

My other clear memory happened either on the 11th or 12th. They were raising the flag in the center. That scene has now become a famous photo. Someone yelled out ""PRESENT ARMS!!"". Instinctively all of us saluted the flag. I remember taps being played but that may be my memory playing tricks on me.

What I said is that it is factually incorrect to say in the case of ""violent crimes"", the DA requests bail. They can choose not to, regardless of what the law says. 

But what anyone that follows local crime closely realizes is that the courts often charge offenders who have lengthy records of assault, threats, strong-arm robbery with misdemeanors, release them, and wash their hands. No reporters follow up closely enough to confirm why someone who might be arrested in December for punching someone down the stairs is free to do it again in six months but it's pretty clear in many cases, offenders are not being sent to prison even for short sentences. 

This woman was charged with attempted murder, I'd like to see what else is in her record. 

As for Rikers - that's the mayor's fault.

Rikers was built to hold a much larger population than it current has, and the DA has publicly said he will refrain from using bail (no real,hard clarification on what offenses he will defer to ROR - meaning it's highly likely he will not ask for bail in cases that can be charged as assault, robbery, etc.), while Dems legislators still demand Rikers be entered.

I had that same situation for a year, with the ceiling collapsing twice.

Super and bad plumbers would come, half-ass the repair, re paint, than slowly drip again. It was literally pee and shit from all of the waste line upstairs: I feel your pain and disgust.

I called 311, inspectors came, months passed... The landlord got fined once, twice, nothing happened.

I kept calling 311, and at the 4th of 5th big fine, the landlord finally called a company to entirely redo the bathroom.

That took 2 months, and I had no discount on rent, some days I had to use the restroom of a nearby cafe, some other times the super would give me the key of another apartment.

I threatened to sue,  the landlord said go for it, I didn't have the money to afford lawyers, tried with some no profit organizations, super complicated.

At the end I got a new bathroom, which lasted for 2 years, then the leak from 3 floors up ended up wetting my ceiling again.

This is a NY story.

I spent 10 years in Harlem, now I live in NJ with my wife in a small home we own, commute 27 mins to Penn via NJ transit, pay way less in mortgage than what we paid in rent, don't miss Harlem at all (we can go there anytime). YMMV.

 Side Blind Spots

 Large vehicles have much larger blind spots on both sides. If you drive in these blind spots, you cannot be seen by the driver. Even if the driver knows you are there, if you remain next to the vehicle it can make it difficult for the driver ability to avoid a dangerous situation.

People can barely stomach prisons as it is right now and an asylum just seems like prison but without as much legal protections. The fact that someone like Britney Spears did not have the right to a lawyer to contest her conservatorship while choreographing her own show and touring is crazy.

My point is that we could probably get more from what we already have. If someone is a ""frequent flyer,"" it sounds like there's an issue with the way the law was written or sentencing.

87279,marebearstare,"Who is QNS Collaborative? We are a diverse group of Queens-based makers, organizers, community members and entrepreneurs collaborating to create a community space that makes creativity and community building accessible.

We envision the fullest embodiment of QNS Collaborative as a cooperatively owned and operated physical space that will offer retail space for small creators and curators community workshops resource, knowledge, and equipment sharing and services + space to community members, organizers, mutual aid groups, and grassroots efforts. We seek to create a solidarity economy, built and controlled collaboratively and cooperatively by community members, for community members.

In this first iteration, QNS Collaborative will manifest as a collaboratively and cooperatively run temporary storefront at 25-09 Astoria Boulevard.

Why Now? Queens has always been full of small creators and self-made businesses, but it has not recently made accessible spaces to amplify and encourage these creators to thrive.

Earlier this year, QNSC surveyed the local community of small business owners and found that the large majority of them were looking for very simple things: an affordable place to sell their goods, resources that would help them take a fledgling business full time, and connection with creators in the broader community. We at QNSC hope to provide that space: one that provides resources, encourages a more localized economy and helps people get invested in their neighborhood‚Äôs wellbeing.

What‚Äôs happening next? It‚Äôs true, we have the opportunity to [temporarily] take over a storefront space at 25-09 Astoria Boulevard [the former home of @earthandme.nyc] and will be hosting a collaboratively and cooperatively run store showcasing Queens-based makers beginning mid-October through March 2022.

Here‚Äôs what we envision in this space:

Space for ~25 Queens-based makers/creatives/curators in a retail store. These Vendor Members will pay a monthly rental fee, consignment fee on sales, and participate in the care and coordination of the store [check the link in bio for more details on this]. Curation and collaboration with 3 Queens-based organizing communities (@queensliberationproject @therollinglibrary and @kaleidospacenyc) ~300 SqFt of storage, coworking, and small-meeting space for Vendor Members Pop-ups Skill-shares shopping parties and small events for the QNSC @patreon Community [more on that coming soon!]

The QNSC Organizing Team has spent a lot of time the past months visiting available commercial spaces, building budgets, and working to realize some IRL version of QNSC in Queens. What we‚Äôve learned is:

You can tell its divisive by how the stories are spun. A few days ago an article was saying how Black people had much lower vaccination rates and was very forgiving of it. Claimed it was due to inequality and unfair on that community

The same day an article talked about how police have low vaccination rates and trashed them for it. The best part is that a lot of cops are black and Hispanic (52% of the force IIRC). There's some serious cross over. You cant say there's an unfair racial divide in vaccination rates but also say fuck the police because they wont get vaccinated.

41564,Eriosyces,"A teenager who last month pleaded guilty to murder in the killing of an 18-year-old Barnard student was sentenced on Thursday to nine years to life in prison.

The teenager, Luchiano Lewis, 16, said last month that he and two friends had gone to Harlem‚Äôs Morningside Park in December 2019 with the goal of robbing someone. The group settled on Tessa Majors, Mr. Lewis said, describing a violent attack on the student that culminated in her death by stabbing.

At the time, Mr. Lewis was 14. Prosecutors at the Manhattan district attorney‚Äôs office chose to charge him and one other member of the group, Rashaun Weaver, as adults. Mr. Weaver, who Mr. Lewis last month said had stabbed Ms. Majors, pleaded not guilty. His trial date is expected to be set early next week.

The third member of their group was 13 at the time of the killing, and confessed to his involvement the day after the crime. (The New York Times is withholding his name because he was a minor and was not charged as an adult.) The boy was later sentenced to up to 18 months in a juvenile detention facility.

The death of Ms. Majors rattled New Yorkers, the sudden violence against a young woman harkening back to an earlier time when the streets were not safe to walk at night.

In the courtroom on Thursday, a prosecutor, Matthew Bogdanos, read aloud from a statement from Ms. Majors‚Äôs family.

‚ÄúOn Dec. 11, 2019, the hopes and dreams of our daughter Tess came to a tragic end,‚Äù the statement said. ‚ÄúNearly two years later, we still find words inadequate to describe the immeasurable pain, trauma and suffering that our family has endured since her senseless murder.‚Äù

As Mr. Bogdanos continued to read, Ms. Majors‚Äôs father, Inman Majors, sat in the front row, his right hand cradling his forehead as he wept.

‚ÄúOur hearts ache as we watch Tess‚Äôs friends return to school, perform in concerts and experience all the things our daughter never will,‚Äù the statement said.

Mr. Bogdanos then played surveillance video of Ms. Majors‚Äôs final moments of life, captured near the corner of 116th Street and Morningside Drive.

As the video played on three large screens ‚Äî including one directly in front of Mr. Lewis, who did not drop his head ‚Äî Mr. Bogdanos narrated for the court what was taking place: Ms. Majors slowly ascending a flight of stairs, after she had already been stabbed at least once in the heart Ms. Majors shuffling toward a street corner Ms. Majors standing near a lamp pole, and collapsing.

After Mr. Bogdanos finished, Mr. Lewis, his voice trembling, addressed the court.

‚ÄúAs a human I feel ashamed, embarrassed and sad at the role I played,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúNothing I say or do can change that fact.‚Äù

He apologized to Mr. Majors for his loss, paused, then addressed his own father.

‚ÄúDad, I am sorry that I failed you and for a moment became less human,‚Äù he said, adding, ‚ÄúI promise I will make you proud again.‚Äù

The judge, Robert Mandelbaum, said before delivering the sentence that Mr. Lewis had repeatedly fought with others imprisoned at the juvenile detention center where he is being held, and that he had participated in the violent slashing of another prisoner.

‚ÄúI agree that one bad choice ‚Äî even one horrific choice ‚Äî standing alone should not prevent leniency in the case of a young offender,‚Äù Justice Mandelbaum said. ‚ÄúBut the defendant has demonstrated in a year and a half since this terrible incident that this was not an aberration.‚Äù

Mr. Lewis was arrested in February 2020. He initially pleaded not guilty, but last month, changed his plea before delivering a lengthy statement, explaining the events of that wintry night in extensive detail. In addition to the nine-years-to-life sentence on the murder charge, he was sentenced to 40 months for robbery, to run concurrently.

Mr. Lewis said that the encounter with Ms. Majors started with Mr. Weaver kicking her in the back. Ms. Majors and Mr. Weaver then began to wrestle on the ground, Mr. Lewis said, adding that using a knife was never part of the plan.

He said that he did not know she had been killed, until the next morning when he saw a news story about the murder on his phone.

In an email, Jeffrey Lichtman, a lawyer representing Mr. Weaver, who like Mr. Lewis is Black, questioned the fairness of trying his client as an adult, particularly amid widespread calls for racial equality in the criminal justice system. Mr. Weaver was also 14 at the time of the attack.

‚ÄúDoes anyone actually think that if Rashaun Weaver was raised as comfortably and with the privilege as the racial justice marchers from the Upper West Side that he would be sitting in a jail cell inside a violent ‚Äòjuvenile center‚Äô for almost two years,‚Äù Mr. Lichtman wrote, ‚Äúrarely getting to see or even speak to his parents?‚Äù",63,10/15/21

Vaccinated folks have a vastly lower rate of both infection and duration, meaning far lower chances of mutation. Evolution is probablistic. Therefore lower mutation rate means slower rate of evolution.  
  
 So if covid can kill a vaccinated person, it's logical to think it can alo mutate in that same person.  
  
I have no clue what you're trying to say here. Mutation has nothing to do with whether or not the host dies. It's just the accumulation of random genetic copying errors when an organism replicates. The more often and longer you are infected, the more replications, and therefore mutations, of the virus you facilitate. Regardless of the outcome.  
  
 Coronavirus mutates just as fast as influenza  
  
It does not. Why do you think this?  
  
 The idea that we can stop covid from mutating is downright idiotic.  
  
Everytime vaccination prevents or lessens the duration of an infection it literally stops covid from mutating. Less cumulative infection time (incidence x average duration) means less replication, means less mutation.    
  
And even if it becomes endemic, vaccinating still drastically reduces the burden on the healthcare system and the economy, not to mention protects vulnerable individuals who can't get vaccinated, which is why we have a flu vaccine every year.",1,8/21/21

In specific, New York magazine's profile on her detailed an internal DBD meeting where people were suggesting to get the word out on an initiative via black hair salons. Wiley then took people to task for not immediately suggesting black barbershops and implied that the omission was proof that they didn't think of black men as good fathers. 

This was an internal DBD administration meeting, so you can imagine how well liberal pols with a high degree of self-regard  took to being implicitly called out as racists when possibly it was just a monetary omission or maybe they had previous experience with such communication efforts, or maybe they sexistly think all mothers care more about their kids. Or any mix of the above, but that's a bad-faith circular firing squad twitter move, not how one builds or maintains relationships.

Politics is responsible for things like the economy, inflation, currency, to laws both civil and criminal, to infrastructure and building zones, to health, education, travel, food supply, etc. minimum wage, the internet, and the list goes on. 

Playing politics is playing the game of life and the GOP is less careful of the ramifications that Dems, yet both parties urge their constituents to get the vaccine! Why? Money!

It travels down into the big tank via the silos and tunnels, and the big tank pumps the water straight into the Edo River, which is big enough to carry the water into the ocean without flooding.

Made glorious summer by this sun of York
And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths
Our bruised arms hung up for monuments
Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,
Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.
Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front
And now, instead of mounting barbed steeds
To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,
He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber
To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.
But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,
Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass
I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty
To strut before a wanton ambling nymph
I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,
Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,
Deformed, unfinish'd, sent before my time
Into this breathing world, scarce half made up,
And that so lamely and unfashionable
That dogs bark at me as I halt by them
Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,
Have no delight to pass away the time,
Unless to spy my shadow in the sun
And descant on mine own deformity:
And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover,
To entertain these fair well-spoken days,
I am determined to prove a villain
And hate the idle pleasures of these days.
Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,
By drunken prophecies, libels and dreams,
To set my brother Clarence and the king
In deadly hate the one against the other:
And if King Edward be as true and just
As I am subtle, false and treacherous,
This day should Clarence closely be mew'd up,
About a prophecy, which says that 'G'
Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be.

This is entirely the point. Society will grab pitchforks when they think it's the right think to do. Culture is culture, good or bad. 

 It isn't just granny, but you bring up a good point that people should care more about homeless vets. Expanded access to social services is absolutely something I agree with. 

It isn't just vets either. Again, I wish the government met our daily needs with that same energy. They don't though, so this entire mandate campaign feels disingenuous. It's politicized and that much is undeniable. 

 I disagree. You have the right to swing your fist. You don't have the right to swing your fist when my face would be in the way. It isn't so much an ideal as a fact that individual rights conflict.

Who came up with these rights? Get the fuck out of my way and you won't get hit. Granny needs to stay home and vax up, that has absolutely nothing to do with me or my wages. What's that phrase reddit loves? Fuck around and find out? Hmmmm

84712,311OperatorThrowaway,"I‚Äôve had three different callers in the past couple weeks that tried to file a report about illegal parking in their neighborhoods. Upon further extensive questioning, it turned out that the person they were trying to report was parking perfectly legally (based on the information the caller provided), but the caller was mad because the person was taking up city street parking space that they felt entitled to. I went back and forth with these 3 callers a few times explaining that if there‚Äôs nothing illegal or untoward happening, there‚Äôs nothing for me to report.

Now, look, I get it. Parking sucks in the city and it sucks when you have to park far from your house. I sympathize with the anger and annoyance. But I really have no patience for people that waste our time calling us when there‚Äôs no rules being broken. I don‚Äôt care that you‚Äôre a taxpayer, I don‚Äôt care that you‚Äôve lived there for 7,000 years, I don‚Äôt care if the plates are from out of state. They could park 20 big fat SUVs on your block and if, based on the information you‚Äôre providing, they‚Äôre somehow managing to comply with parking laws, there‚Äôs nothing I can do. You‚Äôre not entitled to specific street parking!

You can probably tell why these calls stick out to me üòÇ

The other memorable call came on my very first day out of the training room (though technically not yet out of training). I got a lady who immediately demanded a manager and was very verbally belligerent. She was clearly a chronic caller because she knew all about the hierarchy we have here because she insisted on specifically a manager and not one of the other supervisors. She then demanded my ID# (which I have to provide) said that if I connected her to anyone but a manager she‚Äôd sue me. Then she called me a bitch, and that‚Äôs when I kicked her to the supervisor line. We don‚Äôt have to tolerate that kind of behavior.

Finally, I got a call from an inmate once who provided his name, his numbers, and his facility, and then proceeded to make threats against city officials and the mayor. They were vague and unspecified threats, but we have to take them seriously anyway. That one did rattle me, but looking back, I‚Äôm a bit like‚Ä¶.‚ÄùHow are you going to say that on a recorded line after you gave your information? üòÇ‚Äù",11,9/21/21

He got some stuff done, but he also got lazy, and focused too much on identity politics.  The man just didn't have enough conviction, and NYC is a place where you have to make big decisions because it affects so many people.

NYC didn't become the future world in Terminator under his mayorship, but reading comments and even the news you would think otherwise, especially people clutching their pearls at the terrible inconvenience of people being homeless and living in the street they use to get to Whole Foods, yet also claim they think ""old NYC"" was super cool in the 70s and 80s when heroin was at its worst.  And I think people don't realize how much of that is fueled by things like the Post who use guys like de Blasio to say ""LOL democrats are the WORST in every single way, right?!?  The city is crumbling, it's got more crime than anywhere!""  My faux news loving parents honestly believe that.

Blasio was the first democratic mayor since 1993.  Being a democrat doesn't make a candidate/mayor better, but I fear that too many people are falling for the trap that got Trump elected, and would pave the way for some Milotakis-esque asshole to convince people to ""take a chance on an outsider!!!""

19601,ChrisFromLongIsland,"If NYC has to suspend a large portion of the force they should also use this time to reform the fire department. They really are not a fire department anymore. They are true first responders to all types of emergencies. Fires account for about 5% of calls. Also the chance of dying in a fire is very low at this point. Lastly the Corona virus along with the refusal to get the vaccine by fdny members it's not about saving every possible life. Mandaring the vaccine for all NYers  will save 100x more lives than will die in a fire for the next 10 years. If you wanted to save the absolute number of people making the FDNY ensure everyone in NYC is vaccinated would same 100X more New Yorkers than sitting around waiting for fires. 

So the fire department should invest in new equipment, merge with the emt (emt salaries would have to increase and firefighters would have to go down) they would focus on all manner of emergencies. The police would handle potentially violent or criminal emergencies but the fire fighters (the newly named emergency department) would handle the rest. Car accidents, drug overdoses, passed out people, gas smells falls, construction accidents, medical emergencies etc. Really all the things they do now but really are not 100 % focused on. Many many emergency situations are handled by the fire department where they are furst on scene but then the have to wait for emts, police etc who traditionally handle certain jobs. This is dumb. 

I know the fire department is sacrosanct has the strongest union and no politician wants to be see as being against the fire department. This is a common sense proposal that really reflects 95% of what the fire department does anyway. I just want to make them more effective at it.",1,10/28/21

Having fewer people in the station or train adds to this, as no one is able to stay with the patient until medics arrive.

Occasionally this is a good thing, if someone has broken their neck and really needs medical expertise to manage their movement.

im not saying death penalty would scare everyone from doing heinous crimes. i know some criminals like serial killers or criminals who has stack of crimes in their record that got nothing to lose in life would noy give a shit if they die during commission of crime or thru death penalty. 

all im saying is if death penalty is there for people to see that theres a more serious punishment other life imprisonment where they get executed by law. people would think twice killing people. right now, people are not scared of killing anyone because the worst punishment they can get is life imprisonment.

 She was rescued from underneath a parked car up from the streets of Brooklyn.

Apparently it's so rare for a female to be a ginger that the veteranarian just assumed she was a male and didn't bother to check. So he told us that our newly rescued male cat will be fine if we do x y and z. So the first week of adopted life we thought she was a boy and even named 'him' Jones. We finally noticed that he did not have male parts. We were confused and wondering if maybe they were just really small and hard to see. Nope. Turns out the vet just wasn't paying attention.

54582,According_Surround_7,"It is if you factor in the alternative of car ownership.

How many times do you take that 7 day trip yearly. Lets say you do it twice a year. At $85/day for 14 days that is $1200~ yearly.

Compare that to owning a car. Lets say your insurance is only $100 monthly. You fill up $30 of gas conservative 3x monthly so $90, you have to do maintenance on your car and may occasionally get into an accident, someone hit you or some kids broke your mirror off while you slept. $2000 yearly or roughly $166 monthly. Assuming you have street parking where you live but when I had a car I was paying $200 monthly. Assuming $0 for this scenario.

$100+$90+166 = $356 every month or $4272 annually and cost of maintenance can easily balloon. Now surely you use your car for more than that twice a year trip so you get more bang for your buck out of it but that shows up in more gas and more maintenance cost. The worst possible world is if you only use it for those trips in which case you are burning money.

When I sold my car I did the math and realized I was spending $500 monthly to own it. With the $500 saved I moved to manhattan and was able to just walk to work in 10 minutes and my quality of life exploded, now everyone cant do that but lets be honest anout the true cost of owning.",0,10/6/21

1. Obviously vax hasn‚Äôt been approved for toddlers and infants, so I have no clue what the cvs lmao comment is. Just want to make clear bc misinformation.

2. Risk of exposure is always an issue and there will always be steps that can be taken to reduce it. We could all wear surgery level PPE for the rest of our lives. We could all never leave our homes. It‚Äôs not valid to say we should take a measure because it reduces exposure, without weighing the amount of that reduction against the cost of taking the measure. The cost for little kids wearing masks all day everyday here is high. Most of the world (and this country agrees). It‚Äôs not a crazy viewpoint. The reduction in risk to educator is also low. Educators can be vaccinated and can wear masks themselves if they feel at risk. So I‚Äôm personally not convinced that the risk of exposure to the educator goes up significantly if they choose to take those steps for their person protection.

The assumption that 1) logic without emotion is superior to logic and emotion, and 2) failure to recognize that such thinking creates the very biases and blind spots people often attribute to emotion. There is no such thing as a rational choice or logical choice that remains true in all scenario‚Äôs and all people. our environment, our history, our psychology all changes what is rational. Human beings have emotion for a reason. Those emotions serve as important indicators of our state of being, what we find wrong, and how we perceive the world‚Äîwith language being a tool to help communicate those feelings to others. 

Having stated this, the point is that if people are going to mass congregate during a pandemic, let it be for something that is worth the risk to public health. Racism is that worthy risk. Racism kills people every day. From the obvious police brutality and mass incarceration, to the vast inequities seen in healthcare every day, to systemic economic subjugation (Historical and present day), and to the routine acts of violence by perpetuated by white communities. And these deaths aren‚Äôt and have never been insignificant in number. 

In contrast, while the US open, NFL, and MLB are fun entertainment avenues many people enjoy, they are not essential during a pandemic. The average person can‚Äôt afford tickets to these headliner games. And the athletes dependent on them are majority millionaires. The owners and leagues themselves far richer. I do not find it absurd that someone would find this mass gathering frivolous. And while mask wearing was not 100% at BLM, in NYC masks were present in mass. Here, the inverse will likely be the case. Masks will be almost nearly absent because of the city‚Äôs signaling in order to generate revenue. And it‚Äôs wildly inappropriate. These people will transmit the virus to each other, likely not get ill, but take it home to *children, elderly, and vulnerable people* who will get sick. Children, especially because of delta, are suffering and facing long term complications in and outside the hospital, in and outside intubation.

If they‚Äôre so concerned about democracy why are they so actively trying to destroy those pillars of ours? The majority of the GOP believes in conspiracies? Please like what? The stolen election? Sorry that‚Äôs a small minority not a majority the news just blew that up to make the rest of them look like idiots and destroy their credibility? And please did you forget Hillar Clinton never ceded from the election in 2016 and tried to say she won. And what the fuck is so in democratic about election audits IF ANYTHING THEY‚ÄôRE HEALTHY FOR DEMOCRACY AFTER THE AUDIT COME OUT AND REASSURE THE PUBLIC THAT THE ELECTION RESULTS WERE RIGHT FUCKING HALF WHIT SO THERE NO ARGUMENT LEFT TO DEBATE. But your idiot liberal news outlets will call audits a threat to democracy because they wanna incriminate anyone who isn‚Äôt like then.

That the virus originated in a Chinese Lab? Well why else would China block every investigation possible into their laboratory in wuhan. Every other novel virus before this one the origins had been found at around 9 months in we‚Äôre almost 2 years with no origins found. That the media is predominantly Liberal and attacks anyone who isn‚Äôt? CNN just this week tried to say joe Rogan are horse dewormer while having Corona because he doesn‚Äôt have a vaccine but doesn‚Äôt seem to care to report that we left hundreds of Americans in Afghanistan and thousands of Afghans who we left to die and we owe them their freedom to that he just abandoned even though he promised he wouldn‚Äôt leave till everyone was out.

LOOK UP HIS GAFFE COMPILATIONS.  You wanna talk conspiracies as you use the Russia conspiracy LMFAO. Trump ground attacked bombed the shit out of Syria and Russian military contractors multiple times RUSSIAS CLOSEST ALLY IN THE MIDDLE EAST. He stepped up the US‚Äôs defense of Ukraine AND THERE NAVY. He withdrew from treaties with the country. He placed over 50 sanctions against the country INCLUDING ones that were for election intervention! He expelled Russian intelligence officers from DC and NYC and other cities. AND MUCH MORE. joe Biden gave them permission to build a pipeline all throughout Europe, SOMETHING TRUMP BLOCKED, while decommissioning ours and killing tens of thousands do jobs while doing it and dealing a blow to our energy independence. And Trump colluded? Ha if that‚Äôs why why did the muller report SPECIFICALLY state there was no evidence of collusion between Trump and Russia. Why was he not brought to trail a single time after countless investigations in a majority democrat congress. Why were Almost charges against him Dropped and the other ones failed again by a mostly DEMOCRAT congress. why to this day has he not seen a single charge brought up against him in an ALL DEMOCRAT government. That‚Äôs not to say there wasn‚Äôt Russian interference. clearly there was that‚Äôs why HE GAVE THEM PLENTY OF SANCTIONS FOR IT. So much for ‚Äúshowing his difference to Putin‚Äù good try though. ‚ÄúTrump cares more about his Business deals‚Äù must be why his net worth went down exponentially while he was in office and he cut his ties to his companies. ‚ÄúFascist photo op‚Äù lol the cops had that raid of those protestors planned before trump was even going to take the photo they had been planning that raid for days actually. But you would never hear about that listening to CNN and MSLSD. ‚ÄúDems held cuomo accountable‚Äù they told him to leave while the sexual assault stories were the biggest headline so we wouldn‚Äôt be concerned with the bigger issue and that is that fact that his direct choices in office got thousands of seniors killed when he was the golden poster boy of the pandemic. Not to mention he profited millions from his book deal. Democrats couldn‚Äôt afford for the country to see what a total failure his Covid response was because that would reflect terrible on Democrats fascist over reaching policies.

A woman in this industry - along with minorities - is far too often treated poorly. Believe it or not it used to be far, far worse. I'm not saying its perfect now but the level of harassment was off the charts even 15 years ago.

My only thing is tip split. I do think that BOH people should be a part of tip split and in most states they are. We also are pretty mindful of respecting everyone's space in our place. We have a zero asshole policy and my BOH people are all kind of sweethearts - family guys with no interest in anything but coming in, working, collecting a paycheck and going back to their kids and wives. 

You also bring up a good point which I purposefully left out because most people do not understand restaurant finances. All of my BOH people (except delivery guys) are on salary. That check hits their account every week and its always the same amount. FOH people have to hustle for that money and, even though they can average $300 shifts, do not have the same income security as my BOH guys.

I won't even go into what most owners make because the public seems to be under the impression we are all rich especially if the restaurant is consistently busy. Truth is I walk into 90% of places that are slammed and can tell almost instantly the finances really don't work.

68236,Lucky_Eggplant_758,"Enh, I've watched the hearings. 

""All of the reform bills have not exempted violent crimes or anything that could get you to Level 2."" This is not true. I've followed Clean Slate closely. Those on the sex offender registry are the only people exempted. It puts every group at risk for victimhood - seniors, children, the disabled - in immediate danger, which is why it didn't pass. 

We already have an apparatus to apply for expungement. I'm not against that. But I oppose any law that would change PD/DA ability to access a record. 

People act as if there aren't other programs by which ex-cons are placed in jobs and housing. I've worked for a not-for-profit that did the former. 

And I'm not against changing state laws so that someone who pisses outside while drunk isn't on a registry for life, but yes, I think reformers stop at registered sex offenders because that's the third rail - for now. The City Council has a bill on the back burner that would qualify all levels of offenders for protections against housing discrimination, intro 2047. Even you're dishonest or you're ignorant of the general attitude of reformers and bills in this state to that distinction between violent and ""nonviolent"" offense. 

""the kinds of parole violations they‚Äôre lessening punishment for are things like ‚Äòmissing a call with your PO because you were working‚Äô and ‚Äòyour shitty cousin invited a felon to his birthday party.‚Äô"" 


I've read the NPR articles. It's a grossly overexaggerated case - people are penalized for parole violations for good reason, and even then, any law revising parole should totally exclude anyone convicted of a violent offense (including something like misdemeanor assault) within the last decade. 

I have a very hard time believing the parole board chases down people who miss a phone call. Michael Lopez, the guy seen shooting at kids here, was a multiple violent felon on parole when he committed knifepoint robbery in January 2020. He should have gone back to prison IMMEDIATELY, because he had violated parole.

Where do you think this magic place is?  These people are sick or injured, the time I stopped a train it was for someone who fainted and hit their head on the door.  I don't think ""hey buddy, go get in that piss elevator and find yourself help"" is gonna be enough.  

And you seem free with other people's jobs, like an ""oh well, too bad for them"" response.  Why does it have to be a choice in the first place? 

Do you not understand that it's a choice because there are like 1500 stations and the subway doesnt have a magic supply of money to hire just-in-case sick people helpers?  Yeah, it's too bad if you cant be bothered to leave earlier and you CANNOT be late to your job or get fired.  The subway isnt EVER going to be 100% on time.   When I had a job I had to be on time for I planned to get there 20 minutes early every day. I suggest you do the same.

The people paid for running the prison are not accountable for the outcome after the prison. They are paid per day per inmate, so the way to increase profits is to reduce the costs. They don't care if the people being released are worse human beings compared to when they entered.

But the solution needs to be created before dismantling what exists today. Simply releasing the prison population of Rikers would a be political nuke, creating such backlash that would destroy the chances of a proper solution.

  
A proper rehabilitation scheme could start with something like this:  
1) A humane detention center that provides:  
\- Treat the people serving sentences as humans. Offer them the social and psychological counseling they need. Give them education so they can lear skills.  
\- The people serving their sentence can learn the ethics and morals issues which landed them in prison and how to avoid that, but also the skills they could use to live a better life after being released.

  
2) The detention center funds will get paid in two parts: one part while the inmates are there. The second part will be aid only after the inmate is released and has not reoffended.

3) Start with inmates with very short sentences (few months). This way the payment is not too far in the future. If things work well, expand the program, design longer term programs for inmates with long sentences, etc.

4) Inmates can opt out, or be kicked out (if the commit crimes inside). In such cases, send them to Rikers or whichever traditional prison is available so they can continue serving their sentences.",1,10/5/21

We're definitely going to disagree on a lot if you think this guy should spend 20 years in prison for what he did, as sick as it was.

Violent crimes must be punished.

Why?  I honestly don't believe the state has any interest in ""punishing"" people.  Violent people need to be separated from society because they're violent or there is no other way to prevent them from committing non-violent crimes.  And I would hold that they need to remain there as long as they're violent or prone to commit those crimes.  

If you want punishment, advocate to bring whipping and caning to the U.S. like they have in Singapore.  But our system is far from perfect, so there are probably around 20,000 innocent people sitting in prison in the U.S. today.  ""Punishing"" them is something that can't be taken back.

First off, a lot of back to work has been delayed (hopefully not much longer).

And delta, despite its incredible r0, has been halted in its tracks in NYC.  We started plateauing August 15th and have lowered since then, and we have vaccinated hundreds of thousands more since then.

In addition, 65% (and rising) of kids 12 - 17 have been vaccinated. That is an incredible number...they've had access to the vaccine the least amount of time and have vax rates higher than that of white NYers.  

For kids under 12, of course it is a worry, and we need authorization ASAP, but we also know from data that spread amongst them is a lot lower than the average adult, and most teachers (and most of the kids' parents) have been vaccinated or have natural immunity.

Wasn't what I said - but I'm not surprised it was over your head.

To reiterate - your chances of getting sick if you're vaccinated are a fraction of those who aren't.  Your chances of transmitting to others is also fractional if you've experienced a breakthrough versus an unvaccinated person.  Those numbers are only slightly skewed if you have natural immunity - you remain contagious after a second infection longer than someone who's been vaccinated.

So who cares who gets vaccinated?  The people who are trying to prevent the spread of the disease.  The people who are at risk of more severe complications even when they're vaccinated, like the elderly or immunocompromised.  People who legitimately can't get vaccinated, for medical or eligibility reasons, like children.

Children didn't suffer 'statistically zero deaths' - over 400 of them died from COVID.  I know what you're thinking, fuck them, I have my rights to be a selfish asshole and not get vaccinated.

Its job is to help people navigate between stations using the subway network by describing the different services etc. It's job is NOT to tell you how geographically distant two given stations are from one another or even top help you find your way above ground. That is what street maps are for. Use the street map to find your way to the station, use the subway map to find your way between stations, and use the street map again to find your way from your disembarkation point to your destination. It's as simple as that. 

Any of the so-called ""geographically accurate"" maps of the NYC subway are, in fact, equally as distorted and geographically inaccurate as th Vignelli. Go look closely at them and you'll see this is true - on the current map, for example the distance between the 8th and 7th Avenue lines is shown as being almost equivalent to the distance between 8th Avenue and the Hudson River. Is that even remotely close to being ""geographically accurate?"" Take a hard look at any other such spatial relationships and depictions of geography on the current map and you'll see countless inaccuracies. The great sin of the current map is that its curvy, craggly linework misleads people into thinking it is geographically accurate, when in reality, the sizes of landmasses and other geographic landmarks are wildly distorted. The Vignelli-style map drops this pretense the style of the linework communicates that it is simply a diagram to be used for finding your way on the subway network.

One thing from the current map that \*is\* useful is the way it shows the locations of major streets and avenues relative to subway stations. The problem with this as they're currently shown is that the locations of streets are wildly distorted and innacurate on the current map.

Go look at the subway or metro map of literally any other world city on earth. They all use diagrammatic maps. They've been the standard since Harry Beck first introduced the idea with the diagrammatic London Underground map in the '30s. The fact of the matter is that these maps are simply better at depicting train services. It's really time NYC caught up with the rest of the world in this simplest of ways.",1,10/13/21

But you absolutely could translate those floorplates into apartments.  

The bigger issue is actually plumbing.  You can move fresh water overhead but sewage is gravity fed, which means you need to poke lots of holes for toilets/sinks etc.  You also need to vent lines which is why you typically have bathrooms and kitchens stacked with shared walls.  You could still do that.  But you don't have the benefit of exterior walls since so many offices are glass facades.

These NYC/NYS mandates, however, offer no such exemptions - and actually threaten your livelihood in the event of non-compliance. That means they will be evaluated differently than Jacobson. 

Furthermore: you may not have an enumerated constitutional right to your job - but you absolutely have what the SC calls a ""liberty interest"" in your job. Those interests are afforded a great deal of constitutional protection, meaning the State cannot strip them from you wholesale.

This is like saying seatbelts are pointless because people wearing them still die in car accidents. Yes that is technically true but neither seatbelts nor vaccines ever promised to work 100% of the time and in a population where nearly everyone is wearing a seatbelt / is vaccinated, a majority of the deaths will be from people who did everything right and still died.

Now the vaccine isn't the anwser everyone was hoping for.  

It is though. In a population as large as 8 million, even something as rare as 5 in 100,000 will happen 400 times. Therefore is not a contradiction for a vaccine to be 99.995% effective while still hearing one reported breakthrough case every day (this is an example, not the real numbers).

And in Albany, Andrew M. Cuomo, the soon-to-be ex-governor, filed his retirement papers.

Ms. Hochul has kept a busy schedule in her first week as New York‚Äôs governor-in-waiting, basking in the limelight as she juggles national media attention and a government transition after Mr. Cuomo announced he would resign next week.

Ms. Hochul, who takes office on Tuesday, has used the intervening period to introduce herself to most New Yorkers after nearly seven years of being sidelined in a mostly ceremonial role in the Cuomo administration. A Democrat from the Buffalo area, Ms. Hochul made a point of visiting New York City this week, seemingly intent on mending the deeply fractured relationship between Albany and City Hall, saying that she was bringing ‚Äúa different approach to governing.‚Äù

What does the path forward for New York City look like? Democratic mayoral nominee Eric Adams, playwright Jeremy O. Harris and chef Marcus Samuelsson will join Times journalists to explore what the future holds for New York and all American cities, in our latest virtual event for subscribers.
Mr. Cuomo, for his part, has kept a relatively low profile since he announced his resignation last week following a New York State attorney general report that found he sexually harassed multiple women, including government employees, and fostered a toxic workplace.

Mr. Cuomo and Ms. Hochul have not spoken since last Tuesday, when he promised her a smooth transition during a phone call. When the governor issued a major directive on Monday mandating that all health care workers receive at least one dose of the coronavirus vaccine by the end of next month, an accompanying news release noted that Ms. Hochul‚Äôs team ‚Äúwas briefed prior to the announcement.‚Äù

One thing Mr. Cuomo had not done as of Wednesday afternoon was submit his formal resignation letter to the New York Department of State, a requisite ahead of his departure, fueling speculation among his longtime critics about his intentions. His office declined to comment on the matter.

But in a sign that the governor‚Äôs third term is in fact coming to an end, Mr. Cuomo, 63, filed for retirement with the state comptroller‚Äôs office on Tuesday, a requirement that will entitle him to an estimated pension of at least $50,000 a year following his more than 14 years of service, including four years as state attorney general.
The governor also commuted the sentences of five people and fully pardoned five others on Tuesday. He may act on bills sitting on his desk in the coming days.

Hochul officials confirmed that Mr. Cuomo‚Äôs time in office will end at 11:59 p.m. Monday. Ms. Hochul will be sworn in immediately after.

Ms. Hochul met on Tuesday with Mayor Bill de Blasio, who has had an infamously toxic relationship with Mr. Cuomo, to discuss the coronavirus Delta variant, health precautions at schools and public safety. Ms. Hochul posted a picture of the meeting on Twitter that shows the two of them laughing over pastries ‚Äî a starkly different image than any representing the mayor‚Äôs relationship with Mr. Cuomo.

Before the meeting, Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat in his last year in office, said he had a good relationship with Ms. Hochul and, as he has in the past few months, did little to hide his contempt for Mr. Cuomo, saying the outgoing governor ‚Äúwas really aberrant.‚Äù After the hourlong meeting, Mr. de Blasio said, ‚ÄúIt was just a good, healthy, sane ‚Äî emphasize the word sane ‚Äî conversation, which I totally appreciated.‚Äù

Ms. Hochul also met with Jumaane Williams, the city‚Äôs public advocate and a vocal critic of Mr. Cuomo. Her meeting with Mr. Williams drew interest because the two were once political rivals: Mr. Williams ran unsuccessfully for lieutenant governor in 2018, mounting a surprisingly strong bid, but losing to Ms. Hochul by about 7 percentage points.

Losing no time, Ms. Hochul said over the weekend that she would run for governor in 2022, giving her a head start and the advantage of incumbency in what is expected to be a contested field. Mr. Williams, a progressive who is to the left of Ms. Hochul, has not ruled out a run for governor next year.

Ms. Hochul has also begun previewing her administration‚Äôs response to the coronavirus, saying on Wednesday that she anticipates announcing a statewide mask mandate in schools when classes begin next month.

But as she prepares to take office, Ms. Hochul must contend not only with thorny policy issues, but personnel moves, too. She faces difficult decisions over which Cuomo officials she will retain and which she will oust as she seeks to distance herself from the scandals that enveloped the outgoing administration.

On Wednesday, she seemed to suggest there would not be an immediate overhaul of Mr. Cuomo‚Äôs cabinet, saying that she would take up to 45 days to make those decisions. She said she was still in the process of ‚Äúgetting people‚Äôs opinions and putting together the ‚Äòdream team‚Äô to run the State of New York into the future.‚Äù

She has chosen a seasoned Albany strategist as the director of her transition team: Marissa Shorenstein, who was press secretary under Gov. David A. Paterson and the director of communications for Mr. Cuomo‚Äôs campaign in 2010, before leaving for the private sector.

Ms. Hochul has also begun laying the groundwork for her election campaign, saying on Sunday that she would soon pick a lieutenant governor from New York City, an attempt to balance her ticket.

She has hired political consultants with experience on national campaigns, formally filed to run for governor and raked in more than $60,000 in campaign contributions since the release of the state attorney general report. Contributions began to pour in from at least one union previously aligned with Mr. Cuomo, as well as from well-connected donors from Buffalo.

On Wednesday evening, Ms. Hochul is holding a fund-raiser in Buffalo ‚Äî billed as a celebration for her 63rd birthday ‚Äî that had to be moved to a larger location because of a spike in interest. Admission prices range from $50 to more than $1,000 per guest.",1,8/19/21

104430,IIAOPSW,"I'm not claiming any proficiency at language. In fact, I'm an unabashed linguistic philistine. I'm claiming that the task of figuring out a subway map can be done entirely with reasoning skills and absolute zero linguistic comprehension.  

Even knowing absolutely zero Arabic, if I were at a train station in an Arabic country with an Arabic transit map, I could handily commit to memory the rough shape of 2 or 3 of the letters in the station name. Probably I'd pick whichever letters had the simplest shape. Eg ""ok I'm looking for dog with TV antenna, ?, ?, wavy line two dots and it has 5 letters"". This half-arsed description of the station name isn't even close to reading ability or comprehension, but it still works because what are the odds that more than one station has a name matching this pattern? I could also probably figure out which line I'm on because train lines everywhere are usually labelled with a number or a letter or a color or some other easy and simple marking. If the lines on the map are red purple and orange, and you see some train information in the station that's either red, purple, or orange, you can safely make a logical leap about which line you are on. Once you know what line you are on, that completely narrows down where you might be and in turn the number of station names you need to check. Most of the time the task is even easier than that. I don't need to know Arabic to figure out that the writing under the big red circle on the wall-map probably means ""you are here"".  

Remember, commuters are *supposed* to be able to do this at a glance. All commuters, not just the smart ones. Transit systems designers are actively trying to make the easiest puzzle you've ever solved.

 If you based the race bit on the boogeymen comment

Yeah. You brought it up.

 The hivemind blasted ""white supremacist bad"" everywhere and that has become the new boogeymen to my sisters.

I'm assuming you're not trying to say that white supremacy is not bad and that you disagree with the notion of it being prevalent. I'd argue that white supremacy, though not necessarily *violent* white supremacy, is much more common than conservatives would like us to believe. ""The Great Replacement"" theory gets a lot of traction in conservative circles--Hannity and Carlson talk about it on the most watched cable news network in the country.

That said, I don't think that there are skinheads around every corner waiting to jump out and get me, that clearly is a sign of pathological paranoia that your sister is suffering from. But there are lots, and I mean *lots*, of people on the other side that hold very similar paranoid views about antifa despite the fact that the FBI doesn't even consider it an organization at all. Before that it was a Salvadorean gang called MS-13 and illegal immigrants in general. Even if it was true that NPR turned your sister into a paranoiac, using that as justification to vote Republican is being conveniently myopic about the  fear-mongering going on on the other side of the aisle.

 We noticed that they (Hollywood, Facebook CEO, mainstream news, college campus youth) HATED GOP for a long time.

Take it from someone who's worked with Hollywood: Hollywood does not tell people what to think, people tell Hollywood what to think. Whatever you're seeing from Hollywood right now, has been carefully constructed to appeal the most to their most lucrative demographics--that is people with the most disposable income who consume the most entertainment media: mostly young, mostly city-dwellers. That's primarily liberals. It wasn't that long ago that that wasn't the case and Hollywood films looked very different. Go a little farther back and you find a Hollywood that would blackball people from the industry if they were suspected of having communist leanings. Hollywood is only a political machine insofar as it appeals to whichever side will buy the most movie tickets. Fucking Ronald Reagan came out of Hollywood.

Zuckerberg hates the GOP? Are you kidding? Have you seen anything about the Facebook papers just in the last few weeks? We know for a fact that Facebook is giving a pass to extremist right-wing content that would violate its terms of service because this kind of content is a major use driver for Facebook. The absolute last thing that Facebook wants is to get rid of conservatives on their platform. It would be a massive blow to lose them.

Overall man I just don't have a lot of sympathy for this belief that conservatives are some embattled silent majority.

We need to make it easier for them to build and honestly, we need to make it so we have a harder stance that forces NYC to build more. We need to tie some sort of state funding on the condition that x amount of housing gets built, so when states take money on that condition they must build or else they'll be force to as occurred in east side Yonkers scattered site public housing developments (Which NIMBYs opposed to the point of bankrupting Yonkers, but they eventually lost).

87678,JGBronx,"The problem with public wifi is that you have to trust the network you are connecting to. However it is hard to trust a network that makes no effort to ensure that the traffic being transmitted wirelessly has not been tampered with. WPA3 fixes this problem by establishing data encryption on open networks with every client, but both the client and access point need to support WPA3 open networks to pull this off.

It is also a bad idea to assume that most people will be able to figure out if the site or service they are connecting to is actually using HTTPS with TLS 1.3. Only recently Google Chrome has started flagging connections as insecure and only in cases of sites not using HTTPS at all, using TLS 1.0 or TLS 1.1. Google Chrome is not currently warning users about sites using TLS 1.2, which has significant vulnerabilities that an attacker can easily take advantage of, if they have a way to intercept and modify the handshake traffic. Unfortunately, a public wifi network without WPA3 has no way to protect this handshake traffic, making it a particularly easy target for an attacker.

I personally believe there is still merit telling people to not use public wifi without a trusted VPN service, as open networks without WPA3 support are quite common, older devices not supporting WPA3 are also common and slow adoption of TLS 1.3 means that a lot of the burden to figure out if a connection to a site or service is secure falls on the layperson. Once a trusted VPN service is added to the mix, these issues are easily mitigated.

That being said, it is likely that most banks and large corporations are using TLS 1.3. However, a layperson would not be able to easily tell if the next site they visit is using TLS 1.3 and not TLS 1.2, so it's better to always recommend using a trusted VPN service when using public wifi as a measure of good cyber hygiene.",1,9/18/21

Theoretically say we had a uniform population of 100 and all of them are given the same exposure to Covid and suppose x% of the population is vaccinated.

If everyone is vaccinated and 10 people die that means 100% of the deaths are those with vaccinations and the vaccine is 90% effective in preventing death.

If 90 people are vaccinated and 10 people die but 8 were vaccinated and 2 were unvaccinated that means 80% of the deaths are those with vaccines, but the unvaccinated person had a 20% chance of dying as opposed to the vaccinated person who had an 11.25% chance of dying. 

So you can see, if the majority of the population is vaccinated you will see stuff indicating the majority of deaths are from vaccinated individuals despite their odds overall being better with the vaccine.

2824,PromptCritical725,"Rights is rights.  The strategies employed for trashing these two rights are remarkably similar.  ""How can I cleverly restrict this right I don't believe is actually a right without running into that pesky Constitution and court rulings?""

A ""Misfire"" is when a gun is supposed to go off and doesn't.  The phrase you're looking for is ""Negligent discharge"".  Note that it isn't accidental.  If any gun fires unintentionally, its because the person in control of it was being negligent.  Purse?  Stupid because there's always random things in a purse that can get into the trigger guard unless a proper retention system is used.  There are no ""cold"" guns.  Always treat them as if their loaded.  If anyone hands me a ""cold"" gun, I check it myself anyway, and then I still keep my finger off the trigger and don't point it at anyone.  

Here's another similarity: I swear, arguing guns is like listening to hundreds of Todd Akins talking about ""legitimate rape"".  The amount of willful ignorance and Dunning-Kruger-ism is absolutely astounding.  

So some extent this case is payback for the City's actions on the transport case.  NYC had probably the stupidest fucking gun law ever.  Who ever heard of a law making it illegal to take a gun OUT of a city?  The City then waited right up until the case was going to be heard and repealed the law, mooting the case. Presumably they realized how dying on this hill could upset other bits of the gun control apple cart.  I think this trickery kinda pissed off part of the court.  So here we are.  

I am pretty sure that abortions enhance security.  Increasing the ability for people who shouldn't have kids to not have kids, can only reduce the number of worthless shitheads in society, which increases security.

The M60 already stops at Astoria Blvd and the bus ride express to LGA from there would certainly be comparable to that of a subway, assuming the aforementioned barriers are implemented along with increased bus frequency (ideally one every 4 minutes).

I should also add that I am not currently in the United States anymore. Unfortunately, I also realized this document was missing after leaving the country. Will I have to appear in person to request for something like this?",1,9/8/21

61711,ouiserboudreauxxx,"I see what you're saying, but I think the reason it's not effective is because nothing happens if someone doesn't pay a ticket, for example.

If you don't pay a ticket, then in some cases there will be a warrant for arrest, and then there is public outrage when someone gets arrested seemingly for something minor(like jumping a turnstile) but they're really getting arrested for the original offense and the fact that they did not pay the fine or whatever. 

Law-abiding folks know the consequences of not paying, and so they will pay up, but others will not, and that is where our current politicians fail, because they throw up their hands and let the rest do whatever they want.

So I think that is the part that needs to be addressed.

Not to mention, idiot politicians underestimate people and think they're dumb or unsavvy, but people who don't pay tickets know very well that nothing will happen to them, which is why they don't pay them.

Our problems are due to the idiots in charge of the city imo.

It's not that there is no effective way to stop it, it's that the optics don't look good, and our politicians are spineless idiots.",1,10/2/21

It ensures that your body will have the best possible response to the vaccine, and means that should you get unlucky in the future, you won't have a severe case and end up in the ICU with a tube down your throat and a life expectancy of three weeks.

If you wait until people around you start getting Covid, then you will have already been exposed and it could be too late.  Please consider getting the free, highly effective medicine so that you do not die.",3,9/24/21

The points about doctors is valid though. There do seem to be less people interested in being doctors if the pay isn‚Äôt as good. But if taxes on the rich are increased, part of the generated funds can go towards subsidizing pay for hospital employees. Jeff bezos alone could afford to pay every single doctor in the united states for decades without anyone else pitching in a dime, and that‚Äôs assuming he doesn‚Äôt continue making ridiculous profits, which is what he‚Äôs doing. 

At a certain point the accumulation of wealth becomes a ridiculous source of exploitation, and the fact that the money accumulated will NEVER ‚Äútrickle down‚Äù to the people actually working to make those profits for people like bezos is ridiculous.

Under rational basis review, the government has the power to curtail certain liberties, particularly relating to due process, so long as there is a legitimate state interest in that curtailment, and a rational connection between the statute's goal and the remedy that it uses. 

Here, as in *Jacobson*, that legitimate (really more like compelling) state interest is the protection of public health, and the statute requires that people be vaccinated if they work in certain industries that create a high-risk environment for transmission. The means for this, again as with *Jacobson* is through fines, though in and of themseles, they are not really important. All that matters is that the enforcement mechanism is ratiomslly related to the furthrence of the goal.

Back when Atlantic Terminal was being be built, the plan was to thru-run trains via the IRT to Fulton Ave, but we literally cannot do that now if we wanted to because of the regulatory issues. Same deal with anyone who dreams of the PATH integrating into NYCT somehow. Speaking of the PATH, it has massive operating costs because of the dumb, anti-rapid transit regulations it has to follow because it's technically a railroad and not allowed to switch regulatory agencies.

This really is the question now. There's a sizeable contingent of socially powerful people in NYC who think that micromanaging people in this way is not only sustainable but the best way forward for the city. The apartments of journalists on the UWS or in Park Slope are now thinkpiece and government and corporate policy factories, churning out the opinions that we're all supposed to have: that ""living with the virus"" means living with masks, testing, vaccine passes, and endless micromanagement of our personal behavior and social lives.

I'm sure we've all had that discussion with some of our friends or colleagues where one or more of them vocally supports the idea of masks and vaccine passes indefinitely, with increasing scope, and thinks you're a bad person for not agreeing. We've also all met people who are frustratingly passive, who just accept this as their new reality without much thought or contest.

But on the other hand, it's going to be hard for the city to compete when outside its limits there are places where you don't have to show your papers to eat in a restaurant, where neglecting to wear a mask (or at least, expressing a desire to return to *not* wearing one) won't get people staring at you or making assumptions about your politics or your opinions on vaccines.

More accessible public transportation is a long-term solution that will require a lot of planning, funds, political willpower, and time.

And again, the federal mandate includes an option for weekly testing instead, so it is pretty lenient for a ""vaccine mandate"".

What about cutting out a portion of their patronage? 

OSHA mandate is for workers not patrons.

While still early, the NYC indoor vaccine mandate has not been shown to be an economic drain on businesses. On top of that, most tourists who visit will be vaccinated considering it is required to access restaurants and indoor entertainment venues. 

An anti-vaxxer is unlikely to vacation in a very liberal city of a liberal state where there are wide-ranging vaccine mandates. 

&amp#x200B

Are we equipping these businesses w the tools to once again excel or are we hamstringing them?

Getting people vaccinated so COVID-19 becomes fully endemic and doesn‚Äôt pose the risk if shutting the country down again is the best, most practical thing the government can do to help businesses long-term.  


What about the now needed extra bouncer to check and enforce these card checks?

The NYC indoor mandate has been in effect for over a month, and most people can only think of a single viral incident which ended in violence. If this was a significant recurring issue in the city, we‚Äôd all know about it because the NY Post would have made sure to tell us.

 See the section in the Blackstone Wikipedia page entitled ‚ÄúUnited Nations condemnation of the Invitation Homes project and lobbying efforts‚Äù for an example so big and official even they can‚Äôt get it scrubbed from their Wikipedia page.

The United Nations isn‚Äôt the end all and be all determinative institution of what is good and bad. The same Wikipedia section cites Blackstone‚Äôs opposition to California‚Äôs proposed statewide rent control scheme and acts as though it‚Äôs a bad thing, despite economists being in almost unanimous opposition to rent control citing all kinds of bad effects (for example: rent control is one of the reasons housing prices in this very city are so inflated, a result of artificially limiting market rate supply). 

 Blackstone and their buds at Lehman are also the kings of leveraged buyouts. Just a few financial institutions are responsible for much of the hollowing out of the middle class around the developed world by shutting down low-growth, low-margin companies by effectively forcing a buyout and then stripping the company for parts and integrating the parts into a larger business or shutting down the business so one they already own can gain their market share.

What the fuck does this even mean? The ‚Äúhollowing out‚Äù of the middle class, first of all, isn‚Äôt a real thing (the number of people considered middle class in the US has jumped from 62% to 69% in 2019). That said, one of the things that have made middle class living increasingly difficult in recent times is the elevation of housing prices nationwide, which is due to historically low building rates ever since the 2008-09 crisis and NIMBY policies that have limited new construction in the urban areas where Americans increasingly want to live.  It‚Äôs not the result of some conspiracy by Blackstone and other finance firms. Institutions like Blackstone want to build more housing, as evidence by the billions they‚Äôve spent financing new construction through their credit division. They‚Äôve spent billions in this city alone, financing new apartment buildings.

As for their takeovers of dying and less profitable businesses, what exactly do you see as problematic? Firms with mediocre profits aren‚Äôt exactly prolific job creators their anemic position in their respective markets if anything inhibits long term employment prospects a more efficient, ever growing firm can afford to hire more people and exist for longer, too)

 Firing thousands of workers getting paid $15 an hour and hiring 10s of thousands you pay $1.50. Shipping shit all over the world to save pennies at the cost of the environment, so on and so on.

Why do you hate the global poor? Why do you assume your labor is more valuable than that of a foreigner who could do it for less?

 Shipping shit all over the world to save pennies at the cost of the environment, so on and so on.

This is one of the parts of your comment I partly agree with, but for different reasons. 

 These firms have been enabled to do all these things because the financialization of the global economy came along with the dawn of Western neoliberalism and the dedicated erosion of anti-trust

You do realize private equity firms existed prior to the ‚Äúfinancializatin of the US economy‚Äù? lol

Look, I agree that in the world of private equity, there‚Äôs plenty of fat that should be cut off. Many firms make bad deals and eventually go out of business or have their assets acquired by other firms, including other private equity firms (though something tells me your sympathies don‚Äôt extend to workers at inefficient and poor P&ampL record PE firms whose employees will lose their jobs).

You see how you shifted the conversation from Bolsonaro to an unrelated party. It detracts from the important conversations. It ªs a tool used by the far-right, including Brazilians fascists, to divert attention away from the evil, evil acts called upon people in power.

Clinton gutted labor markets in South America, Obama authorized and expanded drone strikes.

41595,myusernameisokay,"Different maps for different use cases- the subway diagram is there to navigate the subway system.

See I disagree with this. The subway map is rough estimation of where the subway goes. But you generally don't just get off the subway and end up at your location. You almost always still need to walk (or bus) to your destination. A map that roughly follow the actual geometry allows for that.

Sometimes you know you want to go to roughly X location. The current location allows for you to look at the map and decide which train you want to take to get their. A highly stylized map doesn't allow for that as much.

I think we need to evaluate the trade offs of each map, and consider which is better. The current map has the obvious benefit that it makes estimating how long you have to walk after taking the subway much easier.",6,10/15/21

21558,herbalcaffeine,"For days, residents in certain pockets of the city have complained that their trash is not getting picked up. 

The head of the city‚Äôs sanitation department is trying to deal with the problem.

""We definitely have pockets of the city, Staten Island and pieces of southern Brooklyn primarily right now, where we are experiencing a service delay,‚Äù said Sanitation Commissioner Edward Grayson. ‚ÄúOne to two days behind.""

The commissioner said eight community districts have been affected, that includes all of Staten Island and five districts in Southern Brooklyn, including community boards 10, 11, 14, 15 and 18.   

Within those neighborhoods, some sanitation trucks are returning to their transfer stations with about half of their normal load.

The commissioner directly attributed the lack of productivity to the upcoming vaccine mandate for all city employees. On Monday, sanitation workers will be suspended without pay if they are not vaccinated. 

""To be honest with you, the mandate is in effect, we had normal routine pick up last week and this week we do not,‚Äù Grayson said. ‚ÄúAnd that is the reality of it. With regard to the amount of tons on every truck, if normally you go out and you pick up 10 tons on every truck and now the trucks are coming back at the end of a work tour with only five tons on it, clearly we have to figure out what that is.""

About 64% of sanitation workers have gotten the shot. Grayson, so far, has not called the delays a coordinated slowdown. For now, it‚Äôs a ‚Äúmiscommunication.‚Äù

""We're definitely talking to the work force and trying to engage the labor partners, doing everything we can to clear up, if this happens to be somewhat of a miscommunication on what's happening as we near the end of the week with the mandate coming into play,"" he said.

Already workers are pulling overtime to try to make up for the missed trash pickups. Should a large portion of the workforce remain unvaccinated, that double duty could get worse. 

The same goes for other agencies: 72% of the NYPD is now vaccinated. 

""We have to prepare as if this were going to go into effect Friday evening, and that's what we're doing,‚Äù Police Commissioner Dermot Shea told NY1 on Tuesday. ‚ÄúAnyone at this point in time, unless something changes, will be put into a leave without pay status.""",38,10/27/21

123403,Wayne_Skylar,"Yeah this always comes up when people talk about traffic and some galaxy brained folks like yourself always bring this shit up. But what you guys don't seem to understand is that people don't sit in traffic unless the trip they are making is of value. Maybe it's a commute to a job that pays better or shopping that is cheaper. 

So yes. Induced demand is a thing, but the fact that a highway has more traffic after expansion isn't a bad thing by itself. It means that more people are finding the trip worth taking *IN SPITE OF* the increased wait. Without the expansion you have people staying local earning less and buying things  that are more expensive. 

Now in a city like New York it makes more sense to invest money in moving people in a way that doesn't involve cars. But reducing any capacity that is already built is in no way a net positive.

And finally, as a car owner, I can promise you that I will always take mass transit over driving when I can. I take the car when a) the time differential would be over a half hour longer and b) when I need the car to haul something. Nobody is driving their car in this city if they can take mass transit. Parking is way too fucked. Fuck, I frequently take a Revel to go places that aren't served by transit because I don't want to lose my parking spot. And listen, I'm not complaining at all.

86787,FuckOffJenn,"New information emerged on Saturday about a brawl outside a popular Italian restaurant in Manhattan that raises questions about initial accounts of the altercation, in which the police said they arrested three women from Texas after they attacked a hostess who had asked them to provide proof of their vaccination status.

In a statement on Thursday, the police said that they had responded to an assault in front of Carmine‚Äôs on the Upper West Side of Manhattan involving a 24-year-old hostess, who told them that she got into a dispute with three women after she requested to see their Covid-19 vaccination cards. The three women were charged with assault and criminal mischief.

But on Saturday, lawyers for both Carmine‚Äôs and the women said that the three women had, in fact, provided documentation of Covid vaccinations. The altercation began after two men who joined their party several minutes later were unable to provide proof, the lawyers for both sides said.

Security camera footage reviewed by The New York Times shows three women, who were with several other people, being ushered into the restaurant after showing documentation near the entrance. Several minutes later, three men arrive to join the group, but only one of the three shows a vaccination card, lawyers for both sides said. A short time later, after the three women, who are Black, have joined the men outside, the fight breaks out.

Justin Moore, a lawyer who represents one of the women, Kaeita Nkeenge Rankin, said that the hostess used a racial slur and spoke condescendingly to the patrons, suggesting that their vaccination cards were fake. He also said the Texas women claim that the hostess assaulted them.

‚ÄúThe hostess begins spouting out derogatory comments, and speaking with two of the women they claim that the N-word is being spewed out‚Äù Mr. Moore said in an interview. ‚ÄúThey also heard the hostess say, ‚ÄòYeah, you guys can leave my restaurant,‚Äô or something very aggressive like that. When Dr. Rankin hears that, she turns around and addresses the hostess. She tells her: ‚ÄòThis isn‚Äôt your restaurant. You‚Äôre just a staff member here. Please address us with respect.‚Äô‚Äù

He called the altercation ‚Äúmutual combat.‚Äù

The restaurant denied the allegations that racism played a role in the conflict.

‚ÄúNothing about this incident suggests race was an issue,‚Äù Carolyn Richmond, a lawyer who represents the restaurant, wrote in an email. ‚ÄúThe pandemic has added a key responsibility to the host position ‚Äî insuring the safety and health of all employees and guests by checking for proof of vaccination in compliance with New York City law.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe idea that anyone would become violent as an employee performs this necessary function is anathema to New York, the hospitality industry and New Yorkers in general,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄúAs all of the women showed proof of vaccination they were all permitted to enter and were in fact seated inside.‚Äù

Amid the dueling accounts, a Black Lives Matter activist said his group planned to demonstrate outside Carmine‚Äôs on Monday to protest the treatment of Black patrons. ‚ÄúRestaurants are using vaccine mandates to enforce their racist beliefs and excluding Black patrons,‚Äù said Hawk Newsome, the co-founder and chairman of Black Lives Matter Greater New York.

Restaurants across New York City have been grappling with how best to adhere to the new mandate from Mayor Bill de Blasio that requires people to prove they have received at least one dose of a virus vaccine before dining indoors. The city began enforcing the rule on Monday.

Most of the burden of enforcement has fallen on restaurant employees, particularly front-of-house staff members who are typically the first to engage with customers.

In addition to Dr. Rankin, 44, police identified the other women who were arrested as Tyonnie Keshay Rankin, 21, of Humble, Texas, and Sally Rechelle Lewis, 49, of Houston. They were released with a court date of Oct. 5.

In the Thursday statement, the police said the three women had struck the hostess, who has not been identified, ‚Äúmultiple times with closed fists.‚Äù It also said that the hostess had sustained ‚Äúbruises and scratches to her face, chest and arm.‚Äù She is resting at home, a representative for the restaurant said.

The footage reviewed by The Times does not include sound, but it suggests tension was already brewing between the hostess and the patrons before the melee began.

In the footage, after the two men were denied entry, a server, wearing a white apron, comes out and talks to the hostess, making hand gestures as if explaining something. Then, footage shows the party of six leaving the restaurant. The hostess leans forward and says something, and the server pulls her back with her arms around her shoulder and gives it a tap, possibly to prevent her from engaging with them.

One of the women, Dr. Rankin, says something to the hostess, pointing a finger at her before getting into what appears to be a verbal dispute with other restaurant staff members, shaking her head. She and the others are led away by another employee, who is Black. Moments later, the party is led back inside the restaurant by its manager. The party crosses paths with the hostess who exits the restaurant.

Footage from inside the hallway shows the hostess brushing past the women as she exits, at which point the women appear to do a double take before pursuing her out the door. It is not clear what occurred in that moment or what might have motivated them to follow her.

Footage from outside the restaurant shows the hostess coming out. Seconds later, one of the patrons, who is wearing glasses, goes up to her from behind, speaks into her ear before shoving her and pulling at her collar. The hostess pushes back and claws back while others try to break them apart.

The melee moves off camera, and one of the attackers is hauled away by one of the servers and one of the men who wasn‚Äôt allowed in, while staff pull the hostess away, trying to calm her down.",18,9/19/21

Like everything else in this city, they can‚Äôt keep up with enforcing the laws or have the infrastructure in place before green lighting any of this new shit.

I see these e-devices used on a daily. Especially the e-skateboards and e-unicycles.

 The city speed limit is up to 25 m.p.h. for e-bikes and 15 m.p.h. for e-scooters. **Riders are required to stay off sidewalks and are allowed to travel in bike lanes and on those streets that have a top speed of up to 30 m.p.h.

Well it means that the greater the load, the greater the probability that you might expel enough to survive the journey onto another host, and find the right cells to attach to, and begin the multiplication process. Turns out that the immune system sometimes can flag these buggers and kill them before they grow to enough numbers as to be statistically likely to succeed their next jump. 

That‚Äôs what vaccines achieve by teaching your immune system how to handle them. But it only teaches the immune system. Therein lies the challenge: some systems learn fast and well, some don‚Äôt do so as effectively, some forget, etc. That‚Äôs the challenge with designing vaccines. 

That‚Äôs also why people had it more than once, or after vaccination. What we hope is to better our odds. There is also the terrific news that in some cases the infection goes unnoticed because it doesn‚Äôt hurt the host, while to the unlucky few it drowns them in their own lung fluid. 

What vaccines DONT do is kill the virus. 

As far as stalling the transfer of virus, well there is much we only learned over time and much we still don‚Äôt know. Take the mask issue: while the virus is tiny and passes through most meshes as is, sometimes it‚Äôs attached to larger particles so they do get trapped. Other times the mesh itself is coated in semi dissolved mucus, etc. A number of factors that can‚Äôt be singled out easily. But what was measurable was that some instances, the data of mask use correlated to reduced transmission. But other factors were at play as well, like, in communities that used masks, other safety measures where welcomed also, so therefore transmission was limited.

A robust program to keep people in housing in the first place, providing actual serious mental health treatment when issues *start* instead of when they've already become destitute, and supplying addicts with a safe, free supply with treatment whenever they're ready would go a long way to preventing people from becoming the lunatics on the street too far gone to just be given housing.

i feel like this force all kids back to school is just another 'stat' to put on the edu dept and mayor's belts, 'hey look all our kids are back in school, we got it under control'..

NYC's system is also much older. Adding new features to an older system will also frequently require having to upgrade infrastructure in addition to adding the new features.

The single largest reason for the MTA's high costs isn't unions, it's the fact that there are only 3 construction companies that have both the ability and the funds to be able to do capital construction work on these big projects. As a result, there's a lot of coordination between the three of them on bidding so they all make out like bandits whenever there's a big project like SAS or ESA.

And yes, the bail laws do not allow for a consideration of dangerousness to the community in the bail determination, as bail is intended to ensure a defendant's return to court.  

That being said, I don't think you can really argue that judges do not routinely set bail for high-level violent felonies (such as murder, rape, or robbery), even when the defendant has no other indication they will not return beyond the charges.  Under the plain application of the bail law, someone who shoots a police officer in the head on video but has no criminal record, no out-of-state connections, and many community ties should be released without bail.

There are no major religions in NYC that have forbidden or even came out against vaccinations.

23452,shayde,"Where in your linked article does it say boys 17-29 have a higher chance of myocarditis than risk of being hospitalized for covid sans vaccine? Also, weird comparison because myocarditis typically doesn't lead to hospitalization. From the article...

 For every million vaccinated boys ages 12 to 17, the shots might cause a maximum of 70 myocarditis cases, but would prevent 5,700 infections, 215 hospitalizations and two deaths, the agency has estimated.

and

 The absolute risk is still very small, and the condition temporary. And studies have shown that Covid-19 is much more likely to cause heart problems compared with vaccination.

They listed only one death potentially related to effects from the vaccine, in someone with a pre-existing heart condition. Also note that out of 2.5 million people, 14 were hospitalized and made full recoveries. Very few myocarditis cases require hospitalization and it typically goes away on its own.",2,10/26/21

102958,HegemonNYC,"Depends on the vaccine. Some of them are sterilizing, but the flu vaccine is much less effective than the Covid vaccine. Our natural immunity to measles or mumps or small pox is pretty sterilizing, it was very rare to get them twice. Our natural immunity to coronaviruses was always partial - we get one coronavirus ‚Äòcold‚Äô every 2-4 years, and there are only 4 (now 5) so they‚Äôve always been able to avoid immunity. They just aren‚Äôt that severe once you have some level of immunity. 

There is some evidence that the ‚ÄòRussian Flu‚Äô pandemic in the late 1800s was one of those coronaviruses. It swept the world, killed lots of older people, and now we all get it as kids and it is almost always mild. Much like Covid 19 is almost always mild in kids, and we can become mostly immune to serious cases but not completely immune.",3,9/9/21

107424,flood-waters,"There are two common approaches:

1. The ""block maximum"" approach: fit a Generalized Extreme Value (or alternate) distribution to the maximum rainfall in each year.
2. The ""peaks over threshold"" approach: define an arbitrary threshold, then use a Poisson distribution to model the time between events over that threshold and a Pareto distribution to model the magnitude of the events over that threshold.

In either case, it's corect to say that if ""100 year storm"" will be exceeded with probability 0.01 (1%) each year, then you can treat ""getting a storm over this threshold"" as a binomial process like flipping a coin (except that the coin is heads 99% of the time).

Thus the probability of \*not\* getting a 100 year storm will be 0.99 (99%) each year. The probability of not getting a 100 year storm over, say, a 30 year mortgage is the probability of not getting it in year 1 AND not getting it in year 2 AND not getting it in year 3... and so on. AND means multiply so you get 0.99\^30 = 0.7397003734 and thus the probability of getting a 100 year storm in 30 years is about 0.26 = 26%.

Of course, if you think that (a) there is a trend caused by, say, climate change or urbanization, or (b) if you think that the way we calculate the ""100 year flood"" is flawed, or (c) if you think that each year is not statistically independent from the one before it, then this calculation could lead you to under-estimate your risk.",3,9/6/21

Before Revel, it was already illegal to have any motorized mode of transport on the sidewalk, even bicycles. If it's motorized, it belongs in the street.

These people who don't follow the rules of the road, will ruin it for everyone.

People assume bc it's ""a bike"" it doesn't matter. They don't realize it does. If you have unpaid ticket violations from bikes or scooters, and you try to get your permit to drive a vehicle, they won't let you unless you pay the tickets in full. Which is indicative they assume if you can't ride a bike or scooter, you are not allowed to get a driver's permit.

It reminds me of the road history of Vietnam. Cars are more expensive than mopeds. So majority of people were on mopeds.

something needs to be done to address the fact that these populations, which are primarily (but not exclusively) black and Latinx, are underrepresented.

The flaw in the de Blasio/Carranza (I know he's gone now) philosophy is if the percent of students in G&ampT programs and specialized high schools is not proportionate to the racial demographics of NYC public school students, the system is flawed and must be abolished or extensively changed. 

They see black and Latino students underrepresented in G&ampT programs and their solution is to blow up the program entirely instead of looking at why black and Latino students living in poverty are struggling more than their Asian and white peers, and working to help those kids. 

&amp#x200B

 The right thing to do was to increase enrichment resources to these communities and increase the number of gifted and talented programs in the schools they're attending to make them more accessible.

While there is always room for improvement, the truth is the city does take steps to accommodate poor kids who have academic potential.   
Like I mentioned earlier, the G&ampT admissions criteria was completely overhauled specifically to allow more poor (non-Asian) minority kids a greater chance of being accepted into the program.  
For specialized high schools, the city offers free test prep via their DREAM Program for poor students.   
As noted, there can always be improvements to resources and accessibility. But constantly trying to reverse-engineer a demographic quota for these programs isn‚Äôt the answer.",1,10/8/21

And that said, most poor people have worse access to public transit options than core dwelling wealthy, but much better than fringe wealthy. The South Bronx, Harlem, And East BK have more similar transit options to the CBD than they do SI or East Queens.

Both core dwelling wealthy and inner city poor are highly dependent on public  transit and have low rates of car ownership. This is evidenced by low rates of ownership in both areas. By contrast, fringe area wealthy have lower rates of public transit  dependency and higher rates of car ownership (most households have cars).",1,10/6/21

LIDAR sensors and 5g enabled learning networks would also develop (just think of Waze but 3D). But they don't have to work everywhere, just in densely-packed areas where taxis would make a ton of money.

During rush hour, there would probably be central routing algorithms that would carpool users along a route to make sure that they're efficient. A self-driving electric bus would also be hilarious because you would have drivers to just keep an eye on them but they'll just be driving themselves. We might see more bus-type vehicles like a 15-seat Sprinter being self-driving and offering personal pickup rather than running fixed bus routes. Given the total cost of owning a car (insurance, fuel, maintenance, cleaning, etc.) it's a shame that most users will not ""max out"" the available miles on their personal vehicles before they rust out. With self-driving taxis, we would get closer to using all the miles available on each car frame.

The overall cost of maintaining an electric car is really small. The biggest issue would be the battery life but Toyota is already offering a 10-year/150,000 mile warranty on their hybrid batteries. Even when high voltage batteries die, it's usually just a few cells that can be replaced. The motors, inverters, and ""transmissions"" are all very reliable to the point that they can run for hundreds of thousands of miles without any significant failures.",1,9/10/21

Most of the people unvaccinated in NYC are minority (apart from Asians) last time I checked. 90% of seniors have the vaccine, and they account for 76% of the deaths, 45+ is 97-99%. They're all highly vaccinated. The anti-COVID-vax people are mainly against the Covid vaccine being forced since they want to live their lives as they see fit. I think it's stupid to think you're Magneto after the shot, but if they know the risks it's their choice. Dragging this out will lead to more mutations since they'll get it slowly not all at once. Can't-get-vaxxed will just have to wait out the antis.

I'm on the fence because I had Covid AND the shot but with those numbers, I can't support this encroachment on freedoms that won't be rolled back. I'm planning on visiting next month but IDK if I'm going to now.

The 5 citywide g&ampt schools are amazing, but serve such a small number of students that they‚Äôre not really making a big difference in the scheme of things. 

The district g&ampt programs are not that good. They are not accelerated, and are often placed in underperforming schools. I know many, many families (mine included) who have turned down district g&ampt in favor of their local zoned schools. I realize that I‚Äôm saying this from a Manhattan-centric perspective where the zoned schools are largely good (and none of the best zoned schools have g&ampt), but the existing g&ampt program was so broken that it didn‚Äôt do what it should have. And that‚Äôs before you even consider how  segregated the g&ampt programs are.

I see two options: 

1. Requiring all basements be accessible to be liveable is an option. (Basically forcing billions of dollars of construction on the landlords which would cause higher rents)
2. Preventing people from having access to basements is an option if an owner can't pay for extra construction, but that would be a waste of space in my opinion. (Removing billions of dollars of real estate from the market which would reduce housing stock causing higher rent prices)",2,9/9/21

21585,SkiingAway,"But again. Gay rights were not a widespread thing with widespread support at the time. ""Raising awareness"" and changing minds among other urban populations like NYC was something protests in NYC could influence.

---------

The population of WV voted for Trump by a nearly 40% margin, and generally speaking they reflexively dislike anything that seems like it's being pushed by the ""liberal elites"" of NYC and big urban cities. 

If there's a news article that there was a large NYC protest about the best side of a coin being Tails, you could run a poll in WV and find out that telling people there about it makes them more likely to support Heads even when they had no prior opinion.

Blocking highways also plays out far worse in terms of optics in the news cycles in places where there are truly no other ways to get anywhere and cars occupy a less controversial place.

-----------

Summarizing my thoughts again:

- Disruptive actions against a population and political establishment already entirely board with the goal accomplishes nothing. I can get a protest to reiterate how widespread support is, but disruptive actions against people on your side...are not helpful.

- The political barrier to more federal climate action in the US is rural Democrats and Republicans. If your actions are not something that works to convince either of those groups, your actions are unhelpful. If your actions are going to make it *harder* to convince either of those groups of people or let those politicians ""change their minds"" towards your side, your actions are actively harmful to efforts to get more aggressive climate policy passed.

 - We can argue all day about how the Senate is unrepresentative, how small states have too much power, etc, but reality is what it is and none of those changes are realistically possible in any near or medium term situation.",1,10/27/21

I remember so distinctly how that made me feel like, maybe, just maybe, everything might be alright.

I was in Brooklyn with my dad, well away from any danger, but very afraid for my mother with whom I could not get into contact.  She worked in the Woolworth Building, and I didn't learn until the evening  that she hadn't been in her office that day.  The images we all saw of that on September 11, 2001 were horrific, but we also saw the absolute best of humanity come forward for each other in our time of deepest need.  Just knowing that the members of my community were doing that for each other made a scared teenage boy feel a little bit safer.  That is what makes me proud to be a New Yorker.

But that was not a consequence of (1) any local policy at all, as shown by it happening around the country and (2) not related to any change in policing or criminal justice system.  And of course that was a spike in certain types of crimes, with overall crime levels being relatively unchanged.  And again, we are already course correcting on the trend since we reopened at end of May.  The crimes that spiked are already down to 2016 levels in recent months... 

And of course crime impacts low income communities disproportionately, as it does in literally every city in the world. 

So long as people like Adams or conservatives frame the recent issues around crime in this city as anything other than pandemic-related, I'm going to call that bullshit.  Many of the same people have whined and moaned about 'liberal' approach on crime being too soft and encouraging, despite crime continually falling.

21892,MasterInterface,"These discussion happens all the time even on this subreddit. It always amount to nothing.

It happens nearly every time the topic of EV comes up, about gas/oil/energy, China, etc.

However capitalism, consumerism, military, and the need to privatize everything are the lifeblood of this country.

Until our country starts becoming far more socialist (most people will rather die than accept the idea of socialism), taxing the rich, and take away power from corporations/rich then not much will change.

Manufacturing will never come back here because the need for profit exceed any environmental concerns.

As China moves more and more to address climate concern, companies have already started a few years ago to outsource to even poorer and less well off countries to exploit so cheap goods can continue to be produce.

The whole push about two years ago about banning Styrofoam and plastic bags was largely influenced by China and most of Asia stop on accepting US trash and ""recyclables"" a few years back. It was spin as a political and corporate move to be Eco-friendly.

Tariff isn't bringing back manufacturing either. Instead all the cost is pass onto consumer. Look at the cost of building materials and items like graphic cards. Graphic cards got a 25% increase due to the tariff being pass onto consumers and it's still flying off the shelf.

Another reason why manufacturing won't come back to the US is because then no one can easily blame China (who produces most of the US's goods) despite US having the highest carbon emission per capita. Our carbon emission will skyrocket. That won't look good for the US.

There are a lot of issues that needs to be resolved before we're even remotely close to combat climate change.

 The MTA did experiment with using taxis on demand and the overall feedback was highly positive because it worked and it was convenient, so why would we strip people of that accessibility?

For-hire vehicles will be exempt from the congestion charge, and that program led to reimbursement anyway.

It would not be possible to provide every single disabled or elderly person a private cab ride whenever without major expense and worsened traffic.

Most random assaults are classified misdemeanors, same for theft which isn't discussed. Misd assault overall is up 2.9% this year, petit larceny 0.4%. In August alone, misd assault was up 10.9%, petit larceny down 6.7%.

And yeah most crime in general isn't reported. NYPD has long been incentivized to not take reports for crime that impacts the numbers, and a lot of police officers will want to avoid things they feel are petty.

If reducing congestion was the goal they would be planning to expand transit options. Instead you get the same mass transit options and if you had the option to commute by car, you're discouraged due to a new tax.

I'm all for paying taxes, if there is a plan. Historically the mta has failed with their existing budget. How can reasonable new Yorkers be assured this won't fail (not raising the money the mta needs, bc they overspent on pensions)?

Why should I think the net result of this congestion policy will be, (a) no significant funding (b) a new tax  (c) less business in nyc restaurants from the burbs patrons 

Politicians and nimby brown nosers have no concept at forward thought. And now that we're in the phase of the environmental assessment look at the comments, ""too long.""
